5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Arthur Young was born in 1741, the son of a clergyman, at Bradfield, in
Suffolk.&nbsp; He was apprenticed to a merchant at Lynn, but his activity
of mind caused him to be busy over many questions of the day.&nbsp; He
wrote when he was seventeen a pamphlet on American politics, for which a
publisher paid him with ten pounds&rsquo; worth of books.&nbsp; He started
a periodical, which ran to six numbers.&nbsp; He wrote novels.&nbsp; When
he was twenty-eight years old his father died, and, being free to take his
own course in life, he would have entered the army if his mother had not
opposed.&nbsp; He settled down, therefore, to farming, and applied to
farming all his zealous energy for reform, and all the labours of his busy
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>pen.&nbsp; In 1768, a year before his father&rsquo;s death, he had
published &ldquo;A Six Weeks&rsquo; Tour through the Southern Counties of
England and Wales,&rdquo; which found many readers.</p>
<p>Between 1768 and 1771 Arthur Young produced also &ldquo;The
Farmer&rsquo;s Letters to the People of England, containing the Sentiments
of a Practical Husbandman on the present State of Husbandry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1770 he published, in two thick quartos, &ldquo;A Course of Experimental
Agriculture, containing an exact Register of the Business transacted during
Five Years on near 300 Acres of various Soils;&rdquo; also in the same year
appeared &ldquo;Rural Economy; or, Essays on the Practical Part of
Husbandry;&rdquo; also in the same year &ldquo;The Farmer&rsquo;s Guide in
Hiring and Stocking Farms,&rdquo; in two volumes, with plans.&nbsp; Also in
the same year appeared his &ldquo;Farmer&rsquo;s Kalendar,&rdquo; of which
the 215th edition was published in 1862.&nbsp; There had been a second
edition of the &ldquo;Six Weeks&rsquo; Tour in <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the South of
England,&rdquo; with enlargements, in 1769, and Arthur Young was encouraged
to go on with increasing vigour to the publication of &ldquo;The
Farmer&rsquo;s Tour through the East of England: being a Register of a
Journey through various Counties, to inquire into the State of Agriculture,
Manufactures, and Population.&rdquo;&nbsp; This extended to four volumes,
and appeared in the years 1770 and 1771.&nbsp; In 1771 also appeared, in
four volumes, with plates, &ldquo;A Six Months&rsquo; Tour through the
North of England, containing an Account of the Present State of
Agriculture, Manufactures, and Population in several Counties of this
Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Arthur Young took all his countrymen into counsel while he was
learning his art, as a farmer who brought to his calling a vigorous spirit
of inquiry with an activity in the diffusion of his thoughts that is a part
of God&rsquo;s gift to the men who have thoughts to diffuse; the instinct
for utterance being almost invariably <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>joined to the power of
suggesting what may help the world.</p>
<p>Whether he was essentially author turned farmer, or farmer turned
author, Arthur Young has the first place in English literature as a
farmer-author.&nbsp; Other practical men have written practical books of
permanent value, which have places of honour in the literature of the farm;
but Arthur Young&rsquo;s writings have won friends for themselves among
readers of every class, and belong more broadly to the literature of the
country.</p>
<p>Between 1766 and 1775 he says that he made &pound;3,000 by his
agricultural writings.&nbsp; The pen brought him more profit than the
plough.&nbsp; He took a hundred acres in Hertfordshire, and said of them,
&ldquo;I know not what epithet to give this soil; sterility falls short of
the idea; a hungry vitriolic gravel&mdash;I occupied for nine years the
jaws of a wolf.&nbsp; A nabob&rsquo;s fortune would sink in the attempt to
raise good arable crops in such a country.&nbsp; <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>My experience and
knowledge had increased from travelling and practice, but all was lost when
exerted on such a spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tried at one time to balance his
farm losses by reporting for the <i>Morning Post</i>, taking a
seventeen-mile walk home to his farm every Saturday night.</p>
<p>In 1780 Arthur Young published this &ldquo;Tour in Ireland, with General
Observations on the Present State of that Kingdom in 1776-78.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The general observations, which give to all his books a wide general
interest, are, in this volume, of especial value to us now.&nbsp; It is
here reprinted as given by Pinkerton.</p>
<p>In 1784 Arthur Young began to edit &ldquo;Annals of Agriculture,&rdquo;
which were continued through forty-five volumes.&nbsp; All writers in it
were to sign their names, but when His Majesty King George III. contributed
a description of Mr. Duckett&rsquo;s Farm at Petersham, he was allowed to
sign himself &ldquo;Ralph Robinson of Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>In
1792 Arthur Young published the first quarto volume, and in 1794 the two
volumes of his &ldquo;Travels during the years 1787-8-9 and 1790,
undertaken more particularly with a view of ascertaining the Cultivation,
Wealth, Resources and National Prosperity of the Kingdom of
France.&rdquo;&nbsp; This led to the official issue in France in 1801, by
order of the Directory, of a translation of Young&rsquo;s agricultural
works, under the title of &ldquo;Le Cultivateur Anglais.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Arthur Young also corresponded with Washington, and received recognition
from the Empress Catherine of Russia, who sent him a gold snuff-box, and
ermine cloaks for his wife and daughter.&nbsp; He was made a Fellow of the
Royal Society.</p>
<p>In 1793 his labours led to the formation of a Board of Agriculture, of
which he was appointed secretary.</p>
<p>When he was set at ease by this appointment, with a house and &pound;400
a year, Arthur Young had <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>been about to experiment on the reclaiming of
four thousand acres of Yorkshire moorland.&nbsp; The Agricultural Board was
dissolved in 1816, four years before surveys of the agriculture of each
county were made for the Agricultural Board, Arthur Young himself
contributing surveys of Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, Norfolk,
Suffolk, and Sussex.</p>
<p>Arthur Young&rsquo;s sight became dim in 1808, and blindness gradually
followed.&nbsp; He died in 1820 at his native village of Bradfield, in
Suffolk, at the age of seventy-nine years.</p>

TOUR IN IRELAND.</h2>
<p>June 19, 1776.&nbsp; Arrived at Holyhead, after an instructive journey
through a part of England and Wales I had not seen before.&nbsp; Found the
packet, the <i>Claremont</i>, Captain Taylor, would sail very soon.&nbsp;
After a tedious passage of twenty-two hours, landed on the 20th in the
morning, at Dunlary, four miles from Dublin, a city which much exceeded my
expectation.&nbsp; The public buildings are magnificent, very many of the
streets regularly laid out, and exceedingly well built.&nbsp; The front of
the Parliament-house is grand, though not so light as a more open finishing
of the roof would have made it.&nbsp; The apartments are spacious, elegant,
and convenient, much beyond that heap of confusion at Westminster, so
inferior to the magnificence to be looked for in the seat of empire.&nbsp;
I was so fortunate as to arrive just in time to see Lord Harcourt, with the
usual ceremonies, prorogue the Parliament.&nbsp; Trinity College is a
beautiful building, and a numerous society; the library is a very fine
room, and well filled.&nbsp; The new Exchange will be another edifice to do
honour in Ireland; it is elegant, cost forty thousand pounds, <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>but deserves a
better situation.&nbsp; From everything I saw, I was struck with all those
appearances of wealth which the capital of a thriving community may be
supposed to exhibit.&nbsp; Happy if I find through the country in diffused
prosperity the right source of this splendour!&nbsp; The common computation
of inhabitants 200,000, but I should suppose exaggerated.&nbsp; Others
guessed the number 140,000 or 150,000.</p>
<p>June 21.&nbsp; Introduced by Colonel Burton to the Lord Lieutenant, who
was pleased to enter into conversation with me on my intended journey, made
many remarks on the agriculture of several Irish counties, and showed
himself to be an excellent farmer, particularly in draining.&nbsp; Viewed
the Duke of Leinster&rsquo;s house, which is a very large stone edifice,
the front simple but elegant, the pediment light; there are several good
rooms; but a circumstance unrivalled is the court, which is spacious and
magnificent, the opening behind the house is also beautiful.&nbsp; In the
evening to the Rotunda, a circular room, ninety feet diameter, an imitation
of Ranelagh, provided with a band of music.</p>
<p>The barracks are a vast building, raised in a plain style, of many
divisions; the principal front is of an immense length.&nbsp; They contain
every convenience for ten regiments.</p>
<p>June 23.&nbsp; Lord Charlemont&rsquo;s house in Dublin is equally
elegant and convenient, the apartments large, handsome, and well disposed,
containing some good <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>pictures, particularly one by Rembrandt, of
Judas throwing the money on the floor, with a strong expression of guilt
and remorse; the whole group fine.&nbsp; In the same room is a portrait of
C&aelig;sar Borgia, by Titian.&nbsp; The library is a most elegant
apartment of about forty by thirty, and of such a height as to form a
pleasing proportion; the light is well managed, coming in from the cove of
the ceiling, and has an exceeding good effect; at one end is a pretty
ante-room, with a fine copy of the Venus de Medicis, and at the other two
small rooms, one a cabinet of pictures and antiquities, the other
medals.&nbsp; In the collection also of Robert Fitzgerald, Esq., in Merion
Square, are several pieces which very well deserve a traveller&rsquo;s
attention; it was the best I saw in Dublin.&nbsp; Before I quit that city I
observe, on the houses in general, that what they call their two-roomed
ones are good and convenient.&nbsp; Mr. Latouche&rsquo;s, in
Stephen&rsquo;s Green, I was shown as a model of this sort, and I found it
well contrived, and finished elegantly.&nbsp; Drove to Lord
Charlemont&rsquo;s villa at Marino, near the city, where his lordship has
formed a pleasing lawn, margined in the higher part by a well-planted
thriving shrubbery, and on a rising ground a banqueting-room, which ranks
very high among the most beautiful edifices I have anywhere seen; it has
much elegance, lightness, and effect, and commands a fine prospect.&nbsp;
The rising ground on which it stands slopes off to an agreeable
accompaniment of wood, <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>beyond which on one side is Dublin Harbour,
which here has the appearance of a noble river crowded with ships moving to
and from the capital.&nbsp; On the other side is a shore spotted with white
buildings, and beyond it the hills of Wicklow, presenting an outline
extremely various.&nbsp; The other part of the view (it would be more
perfect if the city was planted out) is varied, in some places nothing but
wood, in others breaks of prospect.&nbsp; The lawn, which is extensive, is
new grass, and appears to be excellently laid down, the herbage a fine crop
of white clover (<i>trifolium repens</i>), trefoil, rib-grass (<i>plantago
lanceolata</i>), and other good plants.&nbsp; Returned to Dublin, and made
inquiries into other points, the prices of provisions, etc.&nbsp; The
expenses of a family in proportion to those of London are, as five to
eight.</p>
<p>Having the year following lived more than two months in Dublin, I am
able to speak to a few points, which as a mere traveller I could not have
done.&nbsp; The information I before received of the prices of living is
correct.&nbsp; Fish and poultry are plentiful and very cheap.&nbsp; Good
lodgings almost as dear as they are in London; though we were well
accommodated (dirt excepted) for two guineas and a-half a week.&nbsp; All
the lower ranks in this city have no idea of English cleanliness, either in
apartments, persons, or cookery.&nbsp; There is a very good society in
Dublin in a Parliament winter: a great round of dinners and parties; and
balls and suppers every <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>night in the week, some of which are very
elegant; but you almost everywhere meet a company much too numerous for the
size of the apartments.&nbsp; They have two assemblies on the plan of those
of London, in Fishamble Street, and at the Rotunda; and two
gentlemen&rsquo;s clubs, Anthry&rsquo;s and Daly&rsquo;s, very well
regulated: I heard some anecdotes of deep play at the latter, though never
to the excess common at London.&nbsp; An ill-judged and unsuccessful
attempt was made to establish the Italian Opera, which existed but with
scarcely any life for this one winter; of course they could rise no higher
than a comic one.&nbsp; <i>La Buona Figliuola</i>, <i>La Frascatana</i>,
and <i>Il Geloso in Cimento</i>, were repeatedly performed, or rather
murdered, except the parts of Sestini.&nbsp; The house was generally empty,
and miserably cold.&nbsp; So much knowledge of the state of a country is
gained by hearing the debates of a Parliament, that I often frequented the
gallery of the House of Commons.&nbsp; Since Mr. Flood has been silenced
with the Vice-Treasurership of Ireland, Mr. Daly, Mr. Grattan, Sir William
Osborn, and the prime serjeant Burgh, are reckoned high among the Irish
orators.&nbsp; I heard many very eloquent speeches, but I cannot say they
struck me like the exertion of the abilities of Irishmen in the English
House of Commons, owing perhaps to the reflection both on the speaker and
auditor, that the Attorney-General of England, with a dash of his pen, can
reverse, alter, or entirely do away the matured <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>result of all the
eloquence, and all the abilities of this whole assembly.&nbsp; Before I
conclude with Dublin I shall only remark, that walking in the streets
there, from the narrowness and populousness of the principal thoroughfares,
as well as from the dirt and wretchedness of the canaille, is a most uneasy
and disgusting exercise.</p>
<p>June 24.&nbsp; Left Dublin, and passed through the Ph&oelig;nix Park, a
very pleasing ground, at the bottom of which, to the left, the Liffey forms
a variety of landscapes: this is the most beautiful environ of
Dublin.&nbsp; Take the road to Luttrel&rsquo;s Town, through a various
scenery on the banks of the river.&nbsp; That domain is a considerable one
in extent, being above four hundred acres within the wall, Irish measure;
in the front of the house is a fine lawn bounded by rich woods, through
which are many ridings, four miles in extent.&nbsp; From the road towards
the house they lead through a very fine glen, by the side of a stream
falling over a rocky bed, through the dark woods, with great variety on the
sides of steep slopes, at the bottom of which the Liffey is either heard or
seen indistinctly.&nbsp; These woods are of great extent, and so near the
capital, form a retirement exceedingly beautiful.&nbsp; Lord Irnham and
Colonel Luttrel have brought in the assistance of agriculture to add to the
beauties of the place; they have kept a part of the lands in cultivation in
order to lay them down the better to grass; one hundred and fifty acres
have been done, and above two hundred acres <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>most effectually
drained in the covered manner filled with stones.&nbsp; These works are
well executed.&nbsp; The drains are also made under the roads in all wet
places, with lateral short ones to take off the water instead of leaving
it, as is common, to soak against the causeway, which is an excellent
method.&nbsp; Great use has been made of limestone gravel in the
improvements, the effect of which is so considerable, that in several spots
where it was laid on ten years ago, the superiority of the grass is now
similar to what one would expect from a fresh dunging.</p>
<p>Leaving Luttrel&rsquo;s Town I went to St. Wolstan&rsquo;s, which Lord
Harcourt had been so obliging as to desire I would make my quarters, from
whence to view to the right or left.</p>
<p>June 25.&nbsp; To Mr. Clement&rsquo;s, at Killadoon, who has lately
built an excellent house, and planted much about it, with the satisfaction
of finding that all his trees thrive well.&nbsp; I remarked the beech and
larch seemed to get beyond the rest.&nbsp; He is also a good farmer.</p>
<p>June 26.&nbsp; Breakfasted with Colonel Marlay, at Cellbridge, found he
had practised husbandry with much success, and given great attention to it
from the peace of 1763, which put a period to a gallant scene of service in
Germany.&nbsp; Walked through his grounds, which I found in general very
well cultivated; his fences excellent; his ditches five by six and seven by
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>six;
the banks well made, and planted with quicks; the borders dug away, covered
with lime till perfectly slacked, them mixed with dung and carried into the
fields, a practice which Mr. Marlay has found of very great benefit.</p>
<p>Viewed Lucan, the seat of Agmondisham Vesey, Esq., on the banks of the
Liffey.&nbsp; The house is rebuilding, but the wood on the river, with
walks through it, is exceedingly beautiful.&nbsp; The character of the
place is that of a sequestered shade.&nbsp; Distant views are everywhere
shut out, and the objects all correspond perfectly with the impression they
were designed to raise.&nbsp; It is a walk on the banks of the river,
chiefly under a variety of fine wood, which rises on varied slopes, in some
parts gentle, in others steep, spreading here and there into cool meadows,
on the opposite shore, rich banks of wood or shrubby ground.&nbsp; The walk
is perfectly sequestered, and has that melancholy gloom which should ever
dwell in such a place.&nbsp; The river is of a character perfectly suited
to the rest of the scenery, in some places breaking over rocks, in other
silent, under the thick shade of spreading wood.&nbsp; Leaving Lucan, the
next place is Leixlip, a fine one, on the river, with a fall, which in a
wet season is considerable.&nbsp; Then St. Wolstan&rsquo;s, belonging to
the Dean of Derry, a beautiful villa, which is also on the river; the
grounds gay and open, though not without the advantage of much wood,
disposed with judgment.&nbsp; A winding <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>shrubbery quits the
river, and is made to lead through some dressed ground that is pretty and
cheerful.</p>
<p>Mr. Conolly&rsquo;s, at Castle Town, to which all travellers resort, is
the finest house in Ireland, and not exceeded by many in England.&nbsp; It
is a large handsome edifice, situated in the middle of an extensive lawn,
which is quite surrounded with fine plantations disposed to the best
advantage.&nbsp; To the north these unite into very large woods, through
which many winding walks lead, with the convenience of several ornamented
seats, rooms, etc.&nbsp; On the other side of the house, upon the river, is
a cottage, with a shrubbery, prettily laid out; the house commands an
extensive view, bounded by the Wicklow mountains.&nbsp; It consists of
several noble apartments.&nbsp; On the first floor is a beautiful gallery,
eighty feet long, elegantly fitted up.</p>
<p>June 27.&nbsp; Left Lord Harcourt&rsquo;s, and having received an
invitation from the Duke of Leinster, passed through Mr. Conolly&rsquo;s
grounds to his Grace&rsquo;s seat at Cartown.&nbsp; The park ranks among
the finest in Ireland.&nbsp; It is a vast lawn, which waves over gentle
hills, surrounded by plantations of great extent, and which break and
divide in places so as to give much variety.&nbsp; A large but gentle vale
winds through the whole, in the bottom of which a small stream has been
enlarged into a fine river, which throws a cheerfulness through most of the
scenes: over it a handsome stone bridge.&nbsp; There is a great variety on
the banks of this vale; part of it <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>consists of mild and
gentle slopes, part steep banks of thick wood.&nbsp; In another place they
are formed into a large shrubbery, very elegantly laid out, and dressed in
the highest order, with a cottage, the scenery about which is uncommonly
pleasing: and farther on this vale takes a stronger character, having a
rocky bank on one side, and steep slopes scattered irregularly, with wood
on the other.&nbsp; On one of the most rising grounds in the park is a
tower, from the top of which the whole scenery is beheld; the park spreads
on every side in fine sheets of lawn, kept in the highest order by eleven
hundred sheep, scattered over with rich plantations, and bounded by a large
margin of wood, through which is a riding.</p>
<p>From hence took the road to Summerhill, the seat of the Right Hon. H. L.
Rowley.&nbsp; The country is cheerful and rich; and if the Irish cabins
continue like what I have hitherto seen, I shall not hesitate to pronounce
their inhabitants as well off as most English cottagers.&nbsp; They are
built of mud walls eighteen inches or two feet thick, and well thatched,
which are far warmer than the thin clay walls in England.&nbsp; Here are
few cottars without a cow, and some of them two.&nbsp; A bellyful
invariably of potatoes, and generally turf for fuel from a bog.&nbsp; It is
true they have not always chimneys to their cabins, the door serving for
that and window too.&nbsp; If their eyes are not affected with the smoke,
it may be an advantage in warmth.&nbsp; <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Every cottage swarms
with poultry, and most of them have pigs.</p>
<p>Went in the evening to Lord Mornington&rsquo;s at Dangan, who is making
many improvements, which he showed me.&nbsp; His plantations are extensive,
and he has formed a large water, having five or six islands much varied,
and promontories of high land shoot so far into it as to form almost
distant lakes; the effect pleasing.&nbsp; There are above a hundred acres
under water, and his lordship has planned a considerable addition to
it.&nbsp; Returned to Summerhill.</p>
<p>June 29.&nbsp; Left it, taking the road to Slaine, the country very
pleasant all the way; much of it on the banks of the Boyne, variegated with
some woods, planted hedgerows, and gentle hills.&nbsp; The cabins continue
much the same, the same plenty of poultry, pigs, and cows.&nbsp; The cattle
in the road have their fore legs all tied together with straw to keep them
from breaking into the fields; even sheep, and pigs, are all in the same
bondage.</p>
<p>Lord Conyngham&rsquo;s seat, Slaine Castle, on the Boyne, is one of the
most beautiful places I have seen; the grounds are very bold and various,
rising round the castle in noble hills or beautiful inequalities of
surface, with an outline of flourishing plantations.&nbsp; Under the castle
flows the Boyne, in a reach broken by islands, with a very fine shore of
rock on one side, and wood on the other.&nbsp; Through the lower
plantations are <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>ridings, which look upon several beautiful
scenes formed by the river, and take in the distant country, exhibiting the
noblest views of waving Cultinald hills, with the castle finely situated in
the midst of the planted domain, through which the Boyne winds its
beautiful course.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Lambert&rsquo;s house on the same river is a most romantic and
beautiful spot; rocks on the side, rising in peculiar forms very boldly;
the other steep wood, the river bending short between them like a
land-locked basin.</p>
<p>Lord Conyngham&rsquo;s keeping up Slaine Castle, and spending great
sums, though he rarely resides there, is an instance of magnificence not
often met with; while it is so common for absentees to drain the kingdom of
every shilling they can, so contrary a conduct ought to be held in the
estimation which it justly deserves.</p>
<p>June 30.&nbsp; Rode out to view the country and some improvements in the
neighbourhood: the principal of which are those of Lord Chief Baron Foster,
which I saw from Glaston hill, in the road from Slaine to Dundalk.</p>
<p>In conversation with Lord Longford I made many inquiries concerning the
state of the lower classes, and found that in some respects they were in
good circumstances, in others indifferent; they have, generally speaking,
such plenty of potatoes as always to <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>command a bellyful;
they have flax enough for all their linen, most of them have a cow, and
some two, and spin wool enough for their clothes; all a pig, and numbers of
poultry, and in general the complete family of cows, calves, hogs, poultry,
and children pig together in the cabin; fuel they have in the utmost
plenty.&nbsp; Great numbers of families are also supported by the
neighbouring lakes, which abound prodigiously with fish.&nbsp; A child with
a packthread and a crooked pin will catch perch enough in an hour for the
family to live on the whole day, and his lordship has seen five hundred
children fishing at the same time, there being no tenaciousness in the
proprietors of the lands about a right to the fish.&nbsp; Besides perch,
there is pike upwards of five feet long, bream, tench, trout of ten pounds,
and as red as salmon, and fine eels.&nbsp; All these are favourable
circumstances, and are very conspicuous in the numerous and healthy
families among them.</p>
<p>Reverse the medal: they are ill clothed, and make a wretched appearance,
and what is worse, are much oppressed by many who make them pay too dear
for keeping a cow, horse, etc.&nbsp; They have a practice also of keeping
accounts with the labourers, contriving by that means to let the poor
wretches have very little cash for their year&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; This is a
great oppression, farmers and gentlemen keeping accounts with the poor is a
cruel abuse: so many days&rsquo; work for a cabin; so many for a potato
garden; so many for keeping a <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>horse, and so many for a cow, are clear
accounts which a poor man can understand well, but farther it ought never
to go; and when he has worked out what he has of this sort, the rest of his
work ought punctually to be paid him every Saturday night.&nbsp; Another
circumstance mentioned was the excessive practice they have in general of
pilfering.&nbsp; They steal everything they can lay their hands on, and I
should remark, that this is an account which has been very generally given
me: all sorts of iron hinges, chains, locks, keys, etc.; gates will be cut
in pieces, and conveyed away in many places as fast as built; trees as big
as a man&rsquo;s body, and that would require ten men to move, gone in a
night.&nbsp; Lord Longford has had the new wheels of a car stolen as soon
as made.&nbsp; Good stones out of a wall will be taken for a fire-hearth,
etc., though a breach is made to get at them.&nbsp; In short, everything,
and even such as are apparently of no use to them; nor is it easy to catch
them, for they never carry their stolen goods home, but to some
bog-hole.&nbsp; Turnips are stolen by car-loads, and two acres of wheat
plucked off in a night.&nbsp; In short, their pilfering and stealing is a
perfect nuisance.&nbsp; How far it is owing to the oppression of laws aimed
solely at the religion of these people, how far to the conduct of the
gentlemen and farmers, and how far to the mischievous disposition of the
people themselves, it is impossible for a passing traveller to
ascertain.&nbsp; I am apt to believe that a better system of law and <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>management
would have good effects.&nbsp; They are much worse treated than the poor in
England, are talked to in more opprobrious terms, and otherwise very much
oppressed.</p>
<p>Left Packenham Hall.</p>
<p>Two or three miles from Lord Longford&rsquo;s in the way to Mullingar
the road leads up a mountain, and commands an exceeding fine view of Lock
Derrevaragh, a noble water eight miles long, and from two miles to half a
mile over; a vast reach of it, like a magnificent river, opens as you rise
the hill.&nbsp; Afterwards I passed under the principal mountain, which
rises abruptly from the lake into the boldest outline imaginable.&nbsp; The
water there is very beautiful, filling up the steep vale formed by this and
the opposite hills.</p>
<p>Reached Mullingar.</p>
<p>It was one of the fair days.&nbsp; I saw many cows and beasts, and more
horses, with some wool.&nbsp; The cattle were of the same breed that I had
generally seen in coming through the country.</p>
<p>July 5.&nbsp; Left Mullingar, which is a dirty ugly town, and taking the
road to Tullamore, stopped at Lord Belvidere&rsquo;s, with which place I
was as much struck as with any I had ever seen.&nbsp; The house is perched
on the crown of a very beautiful little hill, half surrounded with others,
variegated and melting into one another.&nbsp; It is one of the most
singular places that is <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>anywhere to be seen, and spreading to the eye a
beautiful lawn of undulating ground margined with wood.&nbsp; Single trees
are scattered in some places, and clumps in others; the general effect so
pleasing, that were there nothing further, the place would be beautiful,
but the canvas is admirably filled.&nbsp; Lake Ennel, many miles in length,
and two or three broad, flows beneath the windows.&nbsp; It is spotted with
islets, a promontory of rock fringed with trees shoots into it, and the
whole is bounded by distant hills.&nbsp; Greater and more magnificent
scenes are often met with, but nowhere a more beautiful or a more singular
one.</p>
<p>From Mullingar to Tullespace I found rents in general at twenty
shillings an acre, with much relet at thirty shillings, yet all the crops
except bere were very bad, and full of weeds.&nbsp; About the latter-named
place the farms are generally from one hundred to three hundred acres; and
their course: 1. fallow; 2. bere; 3. oats; 4. oats; 5. oats.&nbsp; Great
quantities of potatoes all the way, crops from forty to eighty barrels.</p>
<p>The road before it comes to Tullamore leads through a part of the bog of
Allen, which seems here extensive, and would make a noble tract of
meadow.&nbsp; The way the road was made over it was simply to cut a drain
on each side, and then lay on the gravel, which, as fast as it was laid and
spread, bore the ears.&nbsp; Along the edges is fine white clover.</p>
<p>In conversation upon the subject of a union with <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Great Britain, I was
informed that nothing was so unpopular in Ireland as such an idea; and that
the great objection to it was increasing the number of absentees.&nbsp;
When it was in agitation, twenty peers and sixty commoners were talked of
to sit in the British Parliament, which would be the resident of eighty of
the best estates in Ireland.&nbsp; Going every year to England would, by
degrees, make them residents; they would educate their children there, and
in time become mere absentees: becoming so they would be unpopular, others
would be elected, who, treading in the same steps, would yield the place
still to others; and thus by degrees, a vast portion of the kingdom now
resident would be made absentees, which would, they think, be so great a
drain to Ireland, that a free trade would not repay it.</p>
<p>I think the idea is erroneous, were it only for one circumstance, the
kingdom would lose, according to this reasoning, an idle race of country
gentlemen, and in exchange their ports would fill with ships and commerce,
and all the consequences of commerce, an exchange that never yet proved
disadvantageous to any country.</p>
<p>Viewed Mount Juliet, Lord Carrick&rsquo;s seat, which is beautifully
situated on a fine declivity on the banks of the Nore, commanding some
extensive plantations that spread over the hills, which rise in a various
manner on the other side of the river.&nbsp; A knoll of lawn rises <!--
page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>among them
with artificial ruins upon it, but the situation is not in unison with the
idea of a ruin, very rarely placed to effect, unless in retired and
melancholy spots.</p>
<p>The river is a very fine one, and has a good accompaniment of well grown
wood.&nbsp; From the cottage a more varied scene is viewed, cheering and
pleasing; and from the tent in the farther plantation a yet gayer one,
which looks down on several bends of the river.</p>
<p>July 11.&nbsp; Left Kilsaine.&nbsp; Mr. Bushe accompanied me to
Woodstock, the seat of Sir W. Fownes.&nbsp; From Thomastown hither is the
finest ride I have yet had in Ireland.&nbsp; The road leaving Thomastown
leads on the east side of the river, through some beautiful copse woods,
which before they were cut must have had a most noble effect, with the
river Nore winding at the bottom.&nbsp; The country then opens somewhat,
and you pass most of the way for six or seven miles to Innisteague, on a
declivity shelving down to the river, which takes a varied winding course,
sometimes lively, breaking over a rocky bottom, at others still and deep
under the gloom of some fine woods, which hang down the sides of steep
hills.&nbsp; Narrow slips of meadow of a beautiful verdure in some places
form the shore, and unite with cultivated fields that spread over the
adjoining hills, reaching almost the mountain tops.&nbsp; These are large
and bold, and give in general to the scenes features of great
magnificence.&nbsp; Passed Sir John <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Hasler&rsquo;s on the
opposite side of the river, finely situated, and Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s farm
on this side, who has very extensive copses which line the river.&nbsp;
Coming in sight of Sir W. Fownes&rsquo;s, the scenery is striking; the road
mounts the side of the hill, and commands the river at the bottom of the
declivity, with groups of trees prettily scattered about, and the little
borough of Innisteague in a most picturesque situation, the whole bounded
by mountains.&nbsp; Cross the bridge, and going through the town, take a
path that leads to a small building in the woods, called Mount
Sandford.&nbsp; It is at the top of a rocky declivity almost perpendicular,
but with brush wood growing from the rocks.&nbsp; At the bottom is the
river, which comes from the right from behind a very bold hanging wood,
that seems to unite with the hill on the opposite shore.&nbsp; At this pass
the river fills the vale, but it widens by degrees, and presents various
reaches, intermixed with little tufts of trees.&nbsp; The bridge we passed
over is half hid.&nbsp; Innisteague is mixed with them, and its buildings
backed by a larger wood, give variety to the scene.&nbsp; Opposite to the
point of view there are some pretty enclosures, fringed with wood, and a
line of cultivated mountain sides, with their bare tops limit the
whole.</p>
<p>Taking my leave of Mr. Bushe, I followed the road to Ross.&nbsp; Passed
Woodstock, of which there is a very fine view from the top of one of the
hills, the house in the centre of a sloping wood of five hundred English
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>acres, and hanging in one noble shade to the river, which flows at
the bottom of a winding glen.&nbsp; From the same hill in front it is seen
in a winding course for many miles through a great extent of enclosures,
bounded by mountains.&nbsp; As I advanced the views of the river Nore were
very fine, till I came to Ross, where from the hill before you go down to
the ferry is a noble scene of the Barrow, a vast river flowing through bold
shores.&nbsp; In some places trees on the bank half obscure it, in others
it opens in large reaches, the effect equally grand and beautiful.&nbsp;
Ships sailing up to the town, which is built on the side of a hill to the
water&rsquo;s edge, enliven the scene not a little.&nbsp; The water is very
deep and the navigation secure, so that ships of seven hundred tons may
come up to the town; but these noble harbours on the coast of Ireland are
only melancholy capabilities of commerce: it is languid and trifling.&nbsp;
There are only four or five brigs and sloops that belong to the place.</p>
<p>Having now passed through a considerable extent of country, in which the
Whiteboys were common, and committed many outrages, I shall here review the
intelligence I received concerning them throughout the county of
Kilkenny.&nbsp; I made many inquiries into the origin of those
disturbances, and found that no such thing as a leveller or Whiteboy was
heard of till 1760, which was long after the landing of Thurot, or the
intending expedition of M. Conflans.&nbsp; That no foreign <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>coin was ever
seen among them, though reports to the contrary were circulated; and in all
the evidence that was taken during ten or twelve years, in which time there
appeared a variety of informers, none was ever taken, whose testimony could
be relied on, that ever proved any foreign interposition.&nbsp; Those very
few who attempted to favour it, were of the most infamous and perjured
characters.&nbsp; All the rest, whose interest it was to make the
discovery, if they had known it, and who concealed nothing else, pretended
to no such knowledge.&nbsp; No foreign money appeared, no arms of foreign
construction, no presumptive proof whatever of such a connection.&nbsp;
They began in Tipperary, and were owing to some inclosures of commons,
which they threw down, levelling the ditches, and were first known by the
name of Levellers.&nbsp; After that, they began with the tithe-proctors
(who are men that hire tithes of the rectors), and these proctors either
screwed the cottars up to the utmost shilling, or relet the tithes to such
as did it.&nbsp; It was a common practice with them to go in parties about
the country, swearing many to be true to them, and forcing them to join by
menaces, which they very often carried into execution.&nbsp; At last they
set up to be general redressers of grievances, punished all obnoxious
persons who advanced the value of lands, or hired farms over their heads;
and, having taken the administration of justice into their hands, were not
very exact in the distribution <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>of it.&nbsp; Forced masters to release their
apprentices, carried off the daughters of rich farmers, and ravished them
into marriages, of which four instances happened in a fortnight.&nbsp; They
levied sums of money on the middling and lower farmers in order to support
their cause, by paying attorneys, etc., in defending prosecutions against
them; and many of them subsisted for some years without work, supported by
these contributions.&nbsp; Sometimes they committed several considerable
robberies, breaking into houses, and taking the money, under pretence of
redressing grievances.&nbsp; In the course of these outrages they burnt
several houses, and destroyed the whole substance of men obnoxious to
them.&nbsp; The barbarities they committed were shocking.&nbsp; One of
their usual punishments (and by no means the most severe) was taking people
out of their beds, carrying them naked in winter on horseback for some
distance, and burying them up to their chin in a hole filled with briars,
not forgetting to cut off their ears.&nbsp; In this manner the evil existed
for eight or ten years, during which time the gentlemen of the country took
some measures to quell them.&nbsp; Many of the magistrates were active in
apprehending them; but the want of evidence prevented punishments, for many
of those who even suffered by them had no spirit to prosecute.&nbsp; The
gentlemen of the country had frequent expeditions to discover them in arms;
but their intelligence was so uncommonly good by their influence over the
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>common people, that not one party that ever went out in quest of
them was successful.&nbsp; Government offered large rewards for
informations, which brought a few every year to the gallows, without any
radical cure for the evil.&nbsp; The reason why it was not more effective
was the necessity of any person that gave evidence against them quitting
their houses and country, or remaining exposed to their resentment.&nbsp;
At last their violence arose to a height which brought on their
suppression.&nbsp; The popish inhabitants of Ballyragget, six miles from
Kilkenny, were the first of the lower people who dared openly to associate
against them; they threatened destruction to the town, gave notice that
they would attack it, were as good as their word, came two hundred strong,
drew up before a house in which were fifteen armed men, and fired in at the
windows; the fifteen men handled their arms so well, that in a few rounds
they killed forty or fifty.&nbsp; They fled immediately, and ever after
left Ballyragget in peace: indeed, they have never been resisted at all
without showing a great want of both spirit and discipline.&nbsp; It
should, however, be observed, that they had but very few arms, those in bad
order, and no cartridges.&nbsp; Soon after this they attacked the house of
Mr. Power in Tipperary, the history of which is well known.&nbsp; His
murder spirited up the gentlemen to exert themselves in suppressing the
evil, especially in raising subscriptions to give private rewards to
whoever would <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>give evidence or information concerning them.&nbsp; The private
distribution had much more effect than larger sums which required a public
declaration; and Government giving rewards to those who resisted them,
without having previously promised it, had likewise some effect.&nbsp; Laws
were passed for punishing all who assembled, and (what may have a great
effect) for recompensing, at the expense of the county or barony, all
persons who suffered by their outrages.&nbsp; In consequence of this
general exertion, above twenty were capitally convicted, and most of them
executed; and the gaols of this and the three neighbouring counties,
Carlow, Tipperary, and Queen&rsquo;s County, have many in them whose trials
are put off till next assizes, and against whom sufficient evidence for
conviction, it is supposed, will appear.&nbsp; Since this all has been
quiet, and no outrages have been committed: but before I quit the subject,
it is proper to remark that what coincided very much to abate the evil was
the fall in the price of lands which has taken place lately.&nbsp; This is
considerable, and has much lessened the evil of hiring farms over the heads
of one another; perhaps, also, the tithe-proctors have not been quite so
severe in their extortions: but this observation is by no means general;
for in many places tithes yet continue to be levied with all those
circumstances which originally raised the evil.</p>
<p>July 15.&nbsp; Leaving Courtown, took the Arklow road; <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>passed a finely wooded
park of Mr. Ram&rsquo;s, and a various country with some good corn in
it.&nbsp; Flat lands by the coast let very high, and mountain at six or
seven shillings an acre, and some at eight shillings or ten
shillings.&nbsp; Passed to Wicklow, prettily situated on the sea, and from
Newrybridge walked to see Mr. Tye&rsquo;s, which is a neat farm, well
wooded, with a river running through the fields.</p>
<p>Reached in the evening Mount Kennedy, the seat of General Cunninghame,
who fortunately proved to me an instructor as assiduous as he is
able.&nbsp; He is in the midst of a country almost his own, for he has
10,000 Irish acres here.&nbsp; His domain, and the grounds about it, are
very beautiful; not a level can be seen; every spot is tossed about in a
variety of hill and dale.&nbsp; In the middle of the lawn is one of the
greatest natural curiosities in the kingdom: an immense arbutus tree,
unfortunately blown down, but yet vegetating.&nbsp; One branch, which parts
from the body near the ground, and afterwards into many large branches, is
six feet two inches in circumference.&nbsp; The General buried part of the
stem as it laid, and it is from several branches throwing out fine young
shoots: it is a most venerable remnant.&nbsp; Killarney, the region of the
arbutus, boasts of no such tree as this.</p>
<p>July 16.&nbsp; Rode in the morning to Drum; a large extent of mountains
and wood on the General&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; It is a very noble scenery; a
vast rocky glen; one side <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>bare rocks to an immense height, hanging in a
thousand whimsical yet frightful forms, with vast fragments tumbled from
them, and lying in romantic confusion; the other a fine mountain side
covered with shrubby wood.&nbsp; This wild pass leads to the bottom of an
amphitheatre of mountain, which exhibits a very noble scenery.&nbsp; To the
right is an immense sweep of mountain completely wooded; taken as a single
object it is a most magnificent one, but its forms are picturesque in the
highest degree; great projections of hill, with glens behind all wooded,
have a noble effect.&nbsp; Every feature of the whole view is great, and
unites to form a scene of natural magnificence.&nbsp; From hence a riding
is cut through the hanging wood, which rises to a central spot, where the
General has cleared away the rubbish from under the wood, and made a
beautiful waving lawn with many oaks and hollies scattered about it: here
he has built a cottage, a pretty, whimsical oval room, from the windows of
which are three views, one of distant rich lands opening to the sea, one
upon a great mountain, and a third upon a part of the lawn.&nbsp; It is
well placed, and forms upon the whole a most agreeable retreat.</p>
<p>July 17.&nbsp; Took my leave of General Cunninghame, and went through
the glen of the downs in my way to Powerscourt.&nbsp; The glen is a pass
between two vast ridges of mountains covered with wood, which have a very
noble effect.&nbsp; The vale is no wider than to admit <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>the road, a small
gurgling river almost by its side, and narrow slips of rocky and shrubby
ground which part them.&nbsp; In the front all escape seems denied by an
immense conical mountain, which rises out of the glen and seems to fill it
up.&nbsp; The scenery is of a most magnificent character.&nbsp; On the top
of the ridge to the right Mr. La Touche has a banqueting-room.&nbsp;
Passing from this sublime scene, the road leads through cheerful grounds
all under corn, rising and falling to the eye, and then to a vale of
charming verdure broken into inclosures, and bounded by two rocky
mountains, distant darker mountains filling up the scene in front.&nbsp;
This whole ride is interesting, for within a mile and a half of
&ldquo;Tinnyhinch&rdquo; (the inn to which I was directed), you come to a
delicious view on the right: a small vale opening to the sea, bounded by
mountains, whose dark shade forms a perfect contrast to the extreme beauty
and lively verdure of the lower scene, consisting of gently swelling lawns
rising from each other, with groups of trees between, and the whole so
prettily scattered with white farms, as to add every idea of
cheerfulness.&nbsp; Kept on towards Powerscourt, which presently came in
view from the edge of a declivity.&nbsp; You look full upon the house,
which appears to be in the most beautiful situation in the world, on the
side of a mountain, half-way between its bare top and an irriguous vale at
its foot.&nbsp; In front, and spreading among woods on either side, is a
lawn whose surface is <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>beautifully varied in gentle declivities,
hanging to a winding river.</p>
<p>Lowering the hill the scenery is yet more agreeable.&nbsp; The near
inclosures are margined with trees, through whose open branches are seen
whole fields of the most lively verdure.&nbsp; The trees gather into
groups, and the lawn swells into gentle inequalities, while the river
winding beneath renders the whole truly pleasing.</p>
<p>Breakfasted at the inn at Tinnyhinch, and then drove to the park to see
the waterfall.&nbsp; The park itself is fine; you enter it between two vast
masses of mountain, covered with wood, forming a vale scattered with trees,
through which flows a river on a broken rocky channel.&nbsp; You follow
this vale till it is lost in a most uncommon manner; the ridges of
mountain, closing, form one great amphitheatre of wood, from the top of
which, at the height of many hundred feet, bursts the water from a rock,
and tumbling down the side of a very large one, forms a scene singularly
beautiful.&nbsp; At the bottom is a spot of velvet turf, from which rises a
clump of oaks, and through their stems, branches and leaves, the falling
water is seen as a background, with an effect more picturesque than can be
well imagined.&nbsp; These few trees, and this little lawn, give the
finishing to the scene.&nbsp; The water falls behind some large fragments
of rock, and turns to the left, down a stony channel, under the shade of a
wood.</p>
<p>Returning to Tinnyhinch, I went to Inniskerry, and <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>gained by this detour
in my return to go to the Dargle, a beautiful view which I should otherwise
have lost.&nbsp; The road runs on the edge of a declivity, from whence
there is a most pleasing prospect of the river&rsquo;s course through the
vale and the wood of Powerscourt, which here appear in large masses of dark
shade, the whole bounded by mountains.&nbsp; Turn to the left into the
private road that leads to the Dargle, and presently it gives a specimen of
what is to be expected by a romantic glen of wood, where the high lands
almost lock into each other, and leave scarce a passage for the river at
bottom, which rages as if with difficulty forcing its way.&nbsp; It is
topped by a high mountain, and in front you catch a beautiful plat of
inclosures bounded by the sea.&nbsp; Enter the Dargle, which is the name of
a glen near a mile long, come presently to one of the finest ranges of wood
I have anywhere seen.&nbsp; It is a narrow glen or vale formed by the sides
of two opposite mountains; the whole thickly spread with oak wood.&nbsp; At
the bottom (and the depth is immense), it is narrowed to the mere channel
of the river, which rather tumbles from rock to rock than runs.&nbsp; The
extent of wood that hangs to the eye in every direction is great, the depth
of the precipice on which you stand immense, which with the roar of the
water at bottom forms a scene truly interesting.&nbsp; In less than a
quarter of a mile, the road passing through the wood leads to another point
of view to the right.&nbsp; It is the crown of <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>a vast projecting rock,
from which you look down a precipice absolutely perpendicular, and many
hundred feet deep, upon the torrent at the bottom, which finds its noisy
way over large fragments of rock.&nbsp; The point of view is a great
projection of the mountain on this side, answered by a concave of the
opposite, so that you command the glen both to the right and left.&nbsp; It
exhibits on both immense sheets of forest, which have a most magnificent
appearance.&nbsp; Beyond the wood to the right, are some inclosures hanging
on the side of a hill, crowned by a mountain.&nbsp; I knew not how to leave
so interesting a spot; the impressions raised by it are strong.&nbsp; The
solemnity of such an extent of wood unbroken by any intervening objects,
and the whole hanging over declivities, is alone great; but to this the
addition of a constant roar of falling water, either quite hid, or so far
below as to be seen but obscurely, united to make those impressions
stronger.&nbsp; No contradictory emotions are raised; no ill-judged temples
appear to enliven a scene that is gloomy rather than gay.&nbsp; Falling or
moving water is a lively object; but this being obscure the noise operates
differently.&nbsp; Following the road a little further, there is another
bold rocky projection from which also there is a double view to the right
and left.&nbsp; In front so immense a sweep of hanging wood, that a nobler
scene can hardly be imagined; the river as before, at the bottom of the
precipice, which is so <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>steep and the depth so great as to be quite
fearful to look down.&nbsp; This horrid precipice, the pointed bleak
mountains in view, with the roar of the water, all conspire to raise one
great emotion of the sublime.&nbsp; You advance scarcely twenty yards
before a pretty scene opens to the left&mdash;a distant landscape of
inclosures, with a river winding between the hills to the sea.&nbsp;
Passing to the right, fresh scenes of wood appear; half-way to the bottom,
one different from the preceding is seen; you are almost inclosed in wood,
and look to the right through some low oaks on the opposite bank of wood,
with an edging of trees through which the sky is seen, which, added to an
uncommon elegance in the outline of the hill, has a most pleasing
effect.&nbsp; Winding down to a thatched bench on a rocky point, you look
upon an uncommon scene.&nbsp; Immediately beneath is a vast chasm in the
rock, which seems torn asunder to let the torrent through that comes
tumbling over a rocky bed far sunk into a channel embosomed in wood.&nbsp;
Above is a range of gloomy obscure woods, which half overshadow it, and
rising to a vast height, exclude every object.&nbsp; To the left the water
rolls away over broken rocks&mdash;a scene duly romantic.&nbsp; Followed
the path: it led me to the water&rsquo;s edge, at the bottom of the glen,
where is a new scene, in which not a single circumstance hurts the
principal character.&nbsp; In a hollow formed of rock and wood (every
object excluded but those and water) the torrent breaks forth from <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>fragments
of rock, and tumbles through the chasm, rocks bulging over it as if ready
to fall into the channel and stop the impetuous water.&nbsp; The shade is
so thick as to exclude the heavens; all is retired and gloomy, a brown
horror breathing over the whole.&nbsp; It is a spot for melancholy to muse
in.</p>
<p>Return to the carriage, and quit the Dargle, which upon the whole is a
very singular place, different from all I have seen in England, and I think
preferable to most.&nbsp; Cross a murmuring stream, clear as crystal, and,
rising a hill, look back on a pleasing landscape of inclosures, which,
waving over hills, end in mountains of a very noble character.&nbsp; Reach
Dublin.</p>
<p>July 20.&nbsp; To Drogheda, a well-built town, active in trade, the
Boyne bringing ships to it.&nbsp; It was market-day, and I found the
quantity of corn, etc., and the number of people assembled, very great; few
country markets in England more thronged.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Nesbit, to
whom recommended, absent, which was a great loss to me, as I had several
inquiries which remained unsatisfied.</p>
<p>To the field of battle on the Boyne.&nbsp; The view of the scene from a
rising ground which looks down upon it is exceedingly beautiful, being one
of the completest landscapes I have seen.&nbsp; It is a vale, losing itself
in front between bold declivities, above which are some thick woods and
distant country.&nbsp; Through the vale the river winds and forms an
island, the point of which <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>is tufted with trees in the prettiest manner
imaginable; on the other side a rich scenery of wood, among which is Dr.
Norris&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; To the right, on a rising ground on the banks
of the river, is the obelisk, backed by a very bold declivity.&nbsp;
Pursued the road till near it, quitted my chaise, and walked to the foot of
it.&nbsp; It is founded on a rock which rises boldly from the river.&nbsp;
It is a noble pillar, and admirably placed.&nbsp; I seated myself on the
opposite rock, and indulged the emotions which, with a melancholy not
unpleasing, filled my bosom, while I reflected on the consequences that had
sprung from the victory here obtained.&nbsp; Liberty was then
triumphant.&nbsp; May the virtues of our posterity secure that prize which
the bravery of their ancestors won!&nbsp; Peace to the memory of the Prince
to whom, whatever might be his failings, we owed that day memorable in the
annals of Europe!</p>
<p>Returned part of the way, and took the road to Cullen, where the Lord
Chief Baron Forster received me in the most obliging manner, and gave me a
variety of information uncommonly valuable.&nbsp; He has made the greatest
improvements I have anywhere met with.&nbsp; The whole country twenty-two
years ago was a waste sheep-walk, covered chiefly with heath, with some
dwarf furze and fern.&nbsp; The cabins and people as miserable as can be
conceived; not a Protestant in the country, nor a road passable for a
carriage.&nbsp; In a word, perfectly resembling other mountainous tracts,
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and
the whole yielding a rent of not more than from three shillings to four
shillings an acre.&nbsp; Mr. Forster could not bear so barren a property,
and determined to attempt the improvement of an estate of five thousand
acres till then deemed irreclaimable.&nbsp; He encouraged the tenants by
every species of persuasion and expense, but they had so ill an opinion of
the land that he was forced to begin with two or three thousand acres in
his own hands; he did not, however, turn out the people, but kept them in
to see the effects of his operations.</p>
<p>To Dundalk.&nbsp; The view down on this town also very beautiful:
swelling hills of a fine verdure, with many rich inclosures backed by a
bold outline of mountain that is remarkable.&nbsp; Laid at the Clanbrassil
Arms, and found it a very good inn.&nbsp; The place, like most of the Irish
towns I have been in, full of new buildings, with every mark of increasing
wealth and prosperity.&nbsp; A cambric manufacture was established here by
Parliament, but failed; it was, however, the origin of that more to the
north.</p>
<p>July 22.&nbsp; Left Dundalk, took the road through Ravensdale to Mr.
Fortescue, to whom I had a letter, but unfortunately he was in the South of
Ireland.&nbsp; Here I saw many good stone and slate houses, and some bleach
greens; and I was much pleased to see the inclosures creeping high up the
sides of the mountains, stony as they are.&nbsp; Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
situation is very <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>romantic&mdash;on the side of a mountain, with
fine wood hanging on every side, with the lawn beautifully scattered with
trees spreading into them, and a pretty river winding through the vale,
beautiful in itself, but trebly so on information that before he fixed
there it was all a wild waste.&nbsp; Rents in Ravensdale ten shillings;
mountain land two shillings and sixpence to five shillings.&nbsp; Also
large tracts rented by villages, the cottars dividing it among themselves,
and making the mountain common for their cattle.</p>
<p>Breakfasted at Newry&mdash;the Globe, another good inn.&nbsp; This town
appears exceedingly flourishing, and is very well built; yet forty years
ago, I was told, there were nothing but mud cabins in it.&nbsp; This great
rise has been much owing to the canal to Loch Neagh.&nbsp; I crossed it
twice; it is indeed a noble work.&nbsp; I was amazed to see ships of one
hundred and fifty tons and more lying in it, like barges in an English
canal.&nbsp; Here is a considerable trade.</p>
<p>Reached Armagh in the evening, and waited on the Primate.</p>
<p>July 23.&nbsp; His Grace rode out with me to Armagh, and showed me some
of the noble and spirited works by which he has perfectly changed the face
of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The buildings he has erected in seven years,
one would suppose, without previous information, to be the work of an
active life.&nbsp; A list of them will justify this observation.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>He
has erected a very elegant palace, ninety feet by sixty, and forty high, in
which an unadorned simplicity reigns.&nbsp; It is light and pleasing,
without the addition of wings or lesser parts, which too frequently wanting
a sufficient uniformity with the body of the edifice, are unconnected with
it in effect, and divide the attention.&nbsp; Large and ample offices are
conveniently placed behind a plantation at a small distance.&nbsp; Around
the palace is a large lawn, which spreads on every side over the hills, and
is skirted by young plantations, in one of which is a terrace, which
commands a most beautiful view of cultivated hill and dale.&nbsp; The view
from the palace is much improved by the barracks, the school, and a new
church at a distance, all which are so placed as to be exceedingly
ornamental to the whole country.</p>
<p>The barracks were erected under his Grace&rsquo;s directions, and form a
large and handsome edifice.&nbsp; The school is a building of considerable
extent, and admirably adapted for the purpose: a more convenient or a
better contrived one is nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; There are apartments for
a master, a school-room fifty-six feet by twenty-eight, a large
dining-room, and spacious, airy dormitories, with every other necessary,
and a spacious playground walled in; the whole forming a handsome front:
and attention being paid to the residence of the master (the salary is four
hundred pounds a year), the school flourishes, and must prove one of the
greatest advantages to the country <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>of anything that could
have been established.&nbsp; This edifice entirely at the Primate&rsquo;s
expense.&nbsp; The church is erected of white stone, and having a tall
spire makes a very agreeable object in a country where churches and spires
do not abound&mdash;at least, such as are worth looking at.&nbsp; Three
other churches the Primate has also built, and done considerable
reparations to the cathedral.</p>
<p>He has been the means also of erecting a public infirmary, which was
built by subscription, contributing amply to it himself.</p>
<p>A public library he has erected at his own expense, given a large
collection of books, and endowed it.&nbsp; The room is excellently adapted,
forty-five feet by twenty-five, and twenty high, with a gallery, and
apartments for a librarian.</p>
<p>He has further ornamented the city with a market-house and shambles, and
been the direct means, by giving leases upon that condition, of almost
new-building the whole place.&nbsp; He found it a nest of mud cabins, and
he will leave it a well-built city of stone and slate.&nbsp; I heard it
asserted in common conversation that his Grace, in these noble
undertakings, had not expended less than thirty thousand pounds, besides
what he had been the means of doing, though not directly at his own
expense.</p>
<p>In the evening reached Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s at Lurgan, to whom I am
indebted for some valuable information.&nbsp; <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>This gentleman has made
very great improvements in his domain.&nbsp; He has a lake at the bottom of
a slight vale, and around are three walks, at a distance from each other;
the centre one is the principal, and extends two miles.&nbsp; It is well
conducted for leading to the most agreeable parts of the grounds, and for
commanding views of Loch Neagh, and the distant country.&nbsp; There are
several buildings, a temple, green-house, etc.&nbsp; The most beautiful
scene is from a bench on a gently swelling hill, which rises almost on
every side from the water.&nbsp; The wood, the water, and the green slopes,
here unite to form a very pleasing landscape.&nbsp; Let me observe one
thing much to his honour; he advances his tenants money for all the lime
they choose, and takes payment in eight years with rent.</p>
<p>Upon inquiring concerning the emigrations, I found that in 1772 and 1773
they were at the height; that some went from this neighbourhood with
property, but not many.&nbsp; They were in general poor and
unemployed.&nbsp; They find here that when provisions are very cheap, the
poor spend much of their time in whisky-houses.&nbsp; All the drapers wish
that oatmeal was never under one penny a pound.&nbsp; Though farms are
exceedingly divided, yet few of the people raise oatmeal enough to feed
themselves; all go to market for some.&nbsp; The weavers earn by coarse
linens one shilling a day, by fine one shilling and fourpence, and it is
the same with the spinners&mdash;the finer the yarn, the more they <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>earn; but
in common a woman earns about threepence.&nbsp; For coarse linens they do
not reckon the flax hurt by standing for seed.&nbsp; Their own flax is much
better than the imported.</p>
<p>This country is in general beautiful, but particularly so about the
straits that lead into Strangford Loch.&nbsp; From Mr. Savage&rsquo;s door
the view has great variety.&nbsp; To the left are tracts of hilly grounds,
between which the sea appears, and the vast chain of mountains in the Isle
of Man distinctly seen.&nbsp; In front the hills rise in a beautiful
outline, and a round hill projects like a promontory into the strait, and
under it the town amidst groups of trees; the scene is cheerful of itself,
but rendered doubly so by the ships and herring-boats sailing in and
out.&nbsp; To the right the view is crowned by the mountains of Mourne,
which, wherever seen, are of a character peculiarly bold, and even
terrific.&nbsp; The shores of the loch behind Mr. Savage&rsquo;s are bold
ground, abounding with numerous pleasing landscapes; the opposite coast,
consisting of the woods and improvements of Castle Ward, is a fine
scenery.</p>
<p>Called at Lord Bangor&rsquo;s, at Castle Ward, to deliver a letter of
recommendations but unfortunately he was on a sailing party to England;
walked through the woods, etc.&nbsp; The house was built by the present
lord.&nbsp; It is a very handsome edifice, with two principal fronts, but
not of the same architecture, for the one is Gothic and the other
Grecian.&nbsp; From the temple is a fine <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>wooded scene: you look
down on a glen of wood, with a winding hill quite covered with it, and
which breaks the view of a large bay.&nbsp; Over it appears the peninsula
of Strangford, which consists of enclosures and wood.&nbsp; To the right
the bay is bounded by a fine grove, which projects into it.&nbsp; A ship at
anchor added much.&nbsp; The house well situated above several rising
woods; the whole scene a fine one.&nbsp; I remarked in Lord Bangor&rsquo;s
domains a fine field of turnips, but unhoed.&nbsp; There were some cabbages
also.</p>
<p>Belfast is a very well built town of brick, they having no stone quarry
in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The streets are broad and straight, and the
inhabitants, amounting to about fifteen thousand, make it appear lively and
busy.&nbsp; The public buildings are not numerous nor very striking, but
over the exchange Lord Donegal is building an assembly room, sixty feet
long by thirty broad, and twenty-four high; a very elegant room.&nbsp; A
card-room adjoining, thirty by twenty-two, and twenty-two high; a tea-room
of the same size.&nbsp; His lordship is also building a new church, which
is one of the lightest and most pleasing I have anywhere seen: it is
seventy-four by fifty-four, and thirty high to the cornice, the aisles
separated by a double row of columns; nothing can be lighter or more
pleasing.&nbsp; The town belongs entirely to his lordship.&nbsp; Rent of it
&pound;2,000 a year.&nbsp; His estate extends from Drumbridge, near
Lisburn, to Larne, twenty miles in a right line, <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and is ten broad.&nbsp;
His royalties are great, containing the whole of Loch Neagh, which is, I
suppose, the greatest of any subject in Europe.&nbsp; His eel fishery at
Tome, and Port New, on the river Ban, lets for &pound;500 a year; and all
the fisheries are his to the leap at Coleraine.&nbsp; The estate is
supposed to be &pound;31,000 a year, the greatest at present in
Ireland.&nbsp; Inishowen, in Donegal, is his, and is &pound;11,000 of
it.&nbsp; In Antrim, Lord Antrim&rsquo;s is the most extensive property,
being four baronies, and one hundred and seventy-three thousand
acres.&nbsp; The rent &pound;8,000 a year, but re-let for &pound;64,000 a
year, by tenants that have perpetuities, perhaps the cruellest instance in
the world of carelessness for the interests of posterity.&nbsp; The present
lord&rsquo;s father granted those leases.</p>
<p>I was informed that Mr. Isaac, near Belfast, had four acres, Irish
measure, of strong clay land not broken up for many years, which being
amply manured with lime rubbish and sea shells, and fallowed, was sown with
wheat, and yielded &pound;87 9s. at 9s. to 12s. per cwt.&nbsp; Also that
Mr. Whitley, of Ballinderry, near Lisburn, a tenant of Lord
Hertford&rsquo;s, has rarely any wheat that does not yield him &pound;18 an
acre.&nbsp; The tillage of the neighbourhood for ten miles round is doubled
in a few years.&nbsp; Shall export one thousand tons of corn this year from
Belfast, most of it to the West Indies, particularly oats.</p>
<p>August 1.&nbsp; To Arthur Buntin&rsquo;s, Esq., near Belfast; <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the soil a
stiff clay; lets at old rents 10s., new one 18s., the town parks of that
place 30s. to 70s., ten miles round it 10s. to 20s., average 13s.&nbsp; A
great deal of flax sown, every countryman having a little, always on potato
land, and one ploughing: they usually sow each family a bushel of
seed.&nbsp; Those who have no land pay the farmers 20s. rent for the land a
bushel of seed sows, and always on potato land.&nbsp; They plant many more
potatoes than they eat, to supply the market at Belfast; manure for them
with all their dung, and some of them mix dung, earth, and lime, and this
is found to do better.&nbsp; There is much alabaster near the town, which
is used for stucco plaster; sells from &pound;1 1s. to 25s. a ton.</p>
<p>On my way to Antrim, viewed the bleach green of Mr. Thomas Sinclair; it
is the completest I have seen here.&nbsp; I understood that the bleaching
season lasted nine months, and that watering on the grass was quite left
off.&nbsp; Mr. Sinclair himself was not at home, or I should probably have
gained some intelligence that might have been useful.</p>
<p>Crossed the mountains by the new road to Antrim, and found them to the
summits to consist of exceeding good loam, and such as would improve into
good meadow.&nbsp; It is all thrown to the little adjoining farms, with
very little or any rent paid for it.&nbsp; They make no other use of it
than turning their cows on.&nbsp; Pity they do not improve; a work more
profitable <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>than any they could undertake.&nbsp; All the way to Antrim lands
let, at an average, at 8s.&nbsp; The linen manufacture spreads over the
whole country, consequently the farms are very small, being nothing but
patches for the convenience of weavers.</p>
<p>From Antrim to Shanes Castle the road runs at the end of Loch Neagh,
commanding a noble view of it; of such an extent that the eye can see no
land over it.&nbsp; It appears like a perfect sea, and the shore is broken
sand-banks, which look so much like it, that one can hardly believe the
water to be fresh.&nbsp; Upon my arrival at the castle, I was most
agreeably saluted with four men hoeing a field of turnips round it, as a
preparation for grass.&nbsp; These were the first turnip-hoers I have seen
in Ireland, and I was more pleased than if I had seen four emperors.</p>
<p>The castle is beautifully situated on the lake, the windows commanding a
very noble view of it; and this has the finer effect, as the woods are
considerable, and form a fine accompaniment to this noble inland sea.</p>
<p>Rode from Mr. Lesly&rsquo;s to view the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.&nbsp; It
is certainly a very great curiosity as an object for speculation upon the
manner of its formation; whether it owes its origin to fire, and is a
species of lava, or to crystallisation, or to whatever cause, is a point
that has employed the attention of men much more able to decide upon it
than I am; and has been <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>so often treated, that nothing I could say
could be new.&nbsp; When two bits of these basalts are rubbed together
quick, they emit a considerable scent like burnt leather.&nbsp; The scenery
of the Causeway, nor of the adjacent mountains, is very magnificent, though
the cliffs are bold; but for a considerable distance there is a strong
disposition in the rocks to run into pentagonal cylinders, and even at a
bridge by Mr. Lesly&rsquo;s is a rock in which the same disposition is
plainly visible.&nbsp; I believe the Causeway would have struck me more if
I had not seen the prints of Staffa.</p>
<p>Returned to Lesly Hill, and on August 5th departed for Coleraine.&nbsp;
There the Right Hon. Mr. Jackson assisted me with the greatest politeness
in procuring the intelligence I wished about the salmon fishery, which is
the greatest in the kingdom, and viewed both fisheries, above and below the
town, very pleasantly situated on the river Ban.&nbsp; The salmon spawn in
all the rivers that run into the Ban about the beginning of August, and as
soon as they have done, swim to the sea, where they stay till January, when
they begin to return to the fresh water, and continue doing it till August,
in which voyage they are taken.&nbsp; The nets are set in the middle of
January, but by Act of Parliament no nets nor weirs can be kept down after
the 12th of August.&nbsp; All the fisheries on the river Ban let at
&pound;6,000 a year.&nbsp; From the sea to the rock above Coleraine, where
the weirs are built, belongs to <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the London companies; the greatest part of the
rest to Lord Donegal.&nbsp; The eel fisheries let at &pound;1,000 a year,
and the salmon fisheries at Coleraine at &pound;1,000.&nbsp; The eels make
periodical voyages, as the salmon, but instead of spawning in the fresh
water, they go to the sea to spawn, and the young fry return against the
stream; to enable them to do which with greater ease at the leap straw
ropes are hung in the water for them.&nbsp; When they return to sea they
are taken.&nbsp; Many of them weigh nine or ten pounds.&nbsp; The young
salmon are called <i>grawls</i>, and grow at a rate which I should suppose
scarce any fish commonly known equals; for within the year some of them
will come to sixteen and eighteen pounds, but in general ten or twelve
pounds.&nbsp; Such as escape the first year&rsquo;s fishery are salmon; and
at two years old will generally weigh twenty to twenty-five pounds.&nbsp;
This year&rsquo;s fishery has proved the greatest that ever was known, and
they had the largest haul, taking 1,452 salmon at one drag of one
net.&nbsp; In the year 1758 they had 882, which was the next greatest
haul.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of seeing 370 drawn in at once.&nbsp; They
have this year taken 400 tons of fish; 200 sold fresh at a penny and
three-halfpence a pound, and two hundred salted, at &pound;18 and &pound;20
per ton, which are sent to London, Spain, and Italy.&nbsp; The fishery
employs eighty men, and the expenses in general are calculated to equal the
rent.</p>
<p>The linen manufacture is very general about <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Coleraine, coarse
ten-hundred linen.&nbsp; It is carried to Dublin in cars, one hundred and
ten miles, at 5s. per cwt. in summer, and 7s. 6d. in winter.</p>
<p>From Limavady to Derry there is very little uncultivated land.&nbsp;
Within four miles of the latter, rents are from 12s. to 20s.; mountains
paid for but in the gross.&nbsp; Reached Derry at night, and waited two
hours in the dark before the ferry-boat came over for me.</p>
<p>August 7.&nbsp; In the morning went to the bishop&rsquo;s palace to
leave my letters of recommendation; for I was informed of my misfortune in
his being out of the kingdom.&nbsp; He was upon a voyage to Staffa, and had
sent home some of the stones of which it consists.&nbsp; They appeared
perfectly to resemble in shape, colour, and smell, those of the
Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.</p>
<p>August 8.&nbsp; Left Derry, and took the road by Raphoe to the Rev. Mr.
Golding&rsquo;s at Clonleigh, who favoured me with much valuable
information.&nbsp; The view of Derry at the distance of a mile or two is
the most picturesque of any place I have seen.&nbsp; It seems to be built
on an island of bold land rising from the river, which spreads into a fine
basin at the foot of the town; the adjacent country hilly.&nbsp; The scene
wants nothing but wood to make it a perfect landscape.</p>
<p>August 11.&nbsp; Left Mount Charles, and passing through Donegal took
the road to Ballyshannon; came presently to several beautiful landscapes,
swelling hills cultivated, with the bay flowing up <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>among them.&nbsp; They
want nothing but more wood, and are beautiful without it.&nbsp; Afterwards
likewise to the left they rise in various outlines, and die away insensibly
into one another.&nbsp; When the road leads to a full view of the bay of
Donegal, these smiling spots, above which the proud mountains rear their
heads, are numerous, the hillocks of almost regular circular forms.&nbsp;
They are very pleasing from form, verdure, and the water breaking in their
vales.</p>
<p>Before I got to Ballyshannon, remarked a bleach green, which indicates
weaving in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Viewed the salmon-leap at Ballyshannon,
which is let for &pound;400 a year.&nbsp; The scenery of it is very
beautiful.&nbsp; It is a fine fall, and the coast of the river very bold,
consisting of perpendicular rocks with grass of a beautiful verdure to the
very edge.&nbsp; It projects in little promontories, which grew longer as
they approach the sea, and open to give a fine view of the ocean.&nbsp;
Before the fall in the middle of the river, is a rocky island on which is a
curing house, instead of the turret of a ruined castle for which it seems
formed.&nbsp; The town prettily situated on the rising ground on each side
of the river.&nbsp; To Sir James Caldwell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Crossing the
bridge, stopped for a view of the river, which is a very fine one, and was
delighted to see the salmon jump, to me an unusual sight; the water was
perfectly alive with them.&nbsp; Rising the hill, look back on the town;
the situation beautiful, the river presents <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>a noble view.&nbsp;
Come to Belleek, a little village with one of the finest water-falls I
remember anywhere to have seen; viewed it from the bridge.&nbsp; The river
in a very broad sheet comes from behind some wood, and breaks over a bed of
rocks, not perpendicular, but shelving in various directions, and foams
away under the arches, after which it grows more silent and gives a
beautiful bend under a rock crowned by a fine bank of wood.&nbsp; Reached
Castle Caldwell at night, where Sir James Caldwell received me with a
politeness and cordiality that will make me long remember it with
pleasure.</p>
<p>August 15.&nbsp; To Belleisle, the charming seat of the Earl of
Ross.&nbsp; It is an island in Loch Earne, of two hundred Irish acres,
every part of it hill, dale, and gentle declivities; it has a great deal of
wood, much of which is old, and forms both deep shades and open, cheerful
groves.&nbsp; The trees hang on the slopes, and consequently show
themselves to the best advantage.&nbsp; All this is exceedingly pretty, but
it is rendered trebly so by the situation.&nbsp; A reach of the lake passes
before the house, which is situated near the banks among some fine woods,
which give both beauty and shelter.&nbsp; This sheet of water, which is
three miles over, is bounded in front by an island of thick wood, and by a
bold circular hill which is his lordship&rsquo;s deer park; this hill is
backed by a considerable mountain.&nbsp; To the right are four or five fine
clumps of dark wood&mdash;so <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>many islands which rise boldly from the lake;
the water breaks in straits between them, and forms a scene extremely
picturesque.&nbsp; On the other side the lake stretches behind wood in a
strait which forms Belleisle.&nbsp; Lord Ross has made walks round the
island, from which there is a considerable variety of prospect.&nbsp; A
temple is built on a gentle hill, commanding the view of the wooded islands
above-mentioned, but the most pleasing prospect of them is coming out from
the grotto.&nbsp; They appear in an uncommon beauty; two seem to join, and
the water which flows between takes the appearance of a fine bay,
projecting deep into a dark wood: nothing can be more beautiful.&nbsp; The
park hill rises above them, and the whole is backed with mountains.&nbsp;
The home scene at your feet also is pretty; a lawn scattered with trees
that forms the margin of the lake, closing gradually in a thick wood of
tall trees, above the tops of which is a distant view of Cultiegh mountain,
which is there seen in its proudest solemnity.</p>
<p>They plough all with horses three or four in a plough, and all
abreast.&nbsp; Here let it be remarked that they very commonly plough and
harrow with their horses drawing by the tail: it is done every
season.&nbsp; Nothing can put them beside this, and they insist that, take
a horse tired in traces and put him to work by the tail, he will draw
better: quite fresh again.&nbsp; Indignant reader, this is no jest of mine,
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>but
cruel, stubborn, barbarous truth.&nbsp; It is so all over Cavan.</p>
<p>At Clonells, near Castlerea, lives O&rsquo;Connor, the direct descendant
of Roderick O&rsquo;Connor, who was king of Connaught six or seven hundred
years ago; there is a monument of him in Roscommon Church, with his
sceptre, etc.&nbsp; I was told as a certainty that this family were here
long before the coming of the Milesians.&nbsp; Their possessions, formerly
so great, are reduced to three or four hundred pounds a year, the family
having fared in the revolutions of so many ages much worse than the
O&rsquo;Niels and O&rsquo;Briens.&nbsp; The common people pay him the
greatest respect, and send him presents of cattle, etc., upon various
occasions.&nbsp; They consider him as the prince of a people involved in
one common ruin.</p>
<p>Another great family in Connaught is Macdermot, who calls himself Prince
of Coolavin.&nbsp; He lives at Coolavin, in Sligo, and though he has not
above one hundred pounds a year, will not admit his children to sit down in
his presence.&nbsp; This was certainly the case with his father, and some
assured me even with the present chief.&nbsp; Lord Kingsborough, Mr.
Ponsonby, Mr. O&rsquo;Hara, Mr. Sandford, etc., came to see him, and his
address was curious: &ldquo;O&rsquo;Hara, you are welcome!&nbsp; Sandford,
I am glad to see your mother&rsquo;s son&rdquo; (his mother was an
O&rsquo;Brien): &ldquo;as to the rest of ye, come in as ye
can.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. O&rsquo;Hara, of Nymphsfield, is in <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>possession of a
considerable estate in Sligo, which is the remains of great possessions
they had in that country.&nbsp; He is one of the few descendants of the
Milesian race.</p>
<p>To Lord Kingston&rsquo;s, to whom I had a letter, but unfortunately for
me he was at Spa.&nbsp; Walked down to Longford Hill to view the
lake.&nbsp; It is one of the most delicious scenes I ever beheld; a lake of
five miles by four, which fills the bottom of a gentle valley almost of a
circular form, bounded very boldly by the mountains.&nbsp; Those to the
left rise in a noble slope; they lower rather in front, and let in a view
of Strand mountain, near Sligo, above twenty miles off.&nbsp; To the right
you look over a small part of a bog to a large extent of cultivated hill,
with the blue mountains beyond.&nbsp; Were this little piece of bog
planted, the view would be more complete; the hill on which you stand has a
foliage of well-grown trees, which form the southern shore.&nbsp; You look
down on six islands, all wooded, and on a fine promontory to the left,
which shoots far into the lake.&nbsp; Nothing can be more pleasing than
their uncommon variety.&nbsp; The first is small (Rock Island), tufted with
trees, under the shade of which is an ancient building, once the residence
of Macdermot.&nbsp; The next a mixture of lawn and wood.&nbsp; The third,
which appears to join this, is of a darker shade, yet not so thick but you
can see the bright lawn under the trees.&nbsp; House Island is one fine,
thick <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>wood, which admits not a gleam of light, a contrast to the silver
bosom of the lake.&nbsp; Church Island is at a greater distance; this is
also a clump, and rises boldly.&nbsp; Rock Island is of wood; it opens in
the centre and shows a lawn with a building on it.&nbsp; It is impossible
to imagine a more pleasing and cheerful scene.&nbsp; Passed the chapel to
Smithfield Hill, which is a fine rising ground, quite surrounded with
plantations.&nbsp; From hence the view is changed; here the promontory
appears very bold, and over its neck you see another wooded island in a
most picturesque situation.&nbsp; Nothing can be more picturesque than Rock
Island, its ruin overhung with ivy.&nbsp; The other islands assume fresh
and varied outlines, and form upon the whole one of the most luxuriant
scenes I have met with.</p>
<p>The views of the lake and environs are very fine as you go to Boyle; the
woods unite into a large mass, and contrast the bright sheet of water with
their dark shades.</p>
<p>The lands about Kingston are very fine, a rich, dry, yellow, sandy loam,
the finest soil that I have seen in Ireland; all grass, and covered with
very fine bullocks, cows, and sheep.&nbsp; The farms rise to five hundred
acres, and are generally in divisions, parted by stone walls, for oxen,
cows, young cattle, and sheep separate.&nbsp; Some of the lands will carry
an ox and a wether per acre; rents, 15s. to 20s.</p>
<p>Dined at Boyle, and took the road to Ballymoat.&nbsp; <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Crossed an immense
mountainy bog, where I stopped and made inquiries; found that it was ten
miles long, and three and a half over, containing thirty-five square miles;
that limestone quarries were around and in it, and limestone gravel in many
places to be found, and used in the lands that join it.&nbsp; In addition
to this I may add that there is a great road crossing it.&nbsp; Thirty-five
miles are twenty-two thousand four hundred acres.&nbsp; What an immense
field of improvement!&nbsp; Nothing would be easier than to drain it (vast
tracts of land have such a fall), that not a drop of water could
remain.&nbsp; These hilly bogs are extremely different from any I have seen
in England.&nbsp; In the moors in the north the hills and mountains are all
covered with heath, like the Irish bogs, but they are of various soils,
gravel, shingle, moor, etc., and boggy only in spots, but the Irish bog
hills are all pure bog to a great depth without the least variation of
soil; and the bog being of a hilly form, is a proof that it is a growing
vegetable mass, and not owing merely to stagnant water.&nbsp; Sir Laurence
Dundass is the principal proprietor of this.</p>
<p>Reached Ballymoat in the evening, the residence of the Hon. Mr.
Fitzmaurice, where I expected great pleasure in viewing a manufactory, of
which I heard much since I came to Ireland.&nbsp; He was so kind as to give
me the following account of it in the most liberal manner:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;Twenty years ago the late Lord Shelburne came to Ballymoat,
a wild uncultivated region without industry or civility, and the people all
Roman Catholics, without an atom of a manufacture, not even spinning.&nbsp;
In order to change this state of things, his lordship contracted with
people in the north to bring Protestant weavers and establish a
manufactory, as the only means of making the change he wished.&nbsp; This
was done, but falling into the hands of rascals he lost &pound;5,000 by the
business, with only seventeen Protestant families and twenty-six or
twenty-seven looms established for it.&nbsp; Upon his death Lady Shelburne
wished to carry his scheme into execution, and to do it gave much
encouragement to Mr. Wakefield, the great Irish factor in London, by
granting advantageous leases under the contract of building and colonising
by weavers from the north, and carrying on the manufactory.&nbsp; He found
about twenty looms working upon their own account, and made a considerable
progress in this for five years, raising several buildings, cottages for
the weavers, and was going on as well as the variety of his business would
admit, employing sixty looms.&nbsp; He then died, when a stand was made to
all the works for a year, in which everything went much to ruin.&nbsp; Lady
Shelburne then employed a new manager to carry on the manufacture upon his
own account, giving him very profitable grants of lands to encourage him to
do it with spirit.&nbsp; He continued for five years, employing <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>sixty looms
also, but his circumstances failing, a fresh stop was put to the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was that Mr. Fitzmaurice, in the year 1774, determined to
exert himself in pushing on a manufactory which promised to be of such
essential service to the whole country.&nbsp; To do this with effect, he
saw that it was necessary to take it entirely into his own hands.&nbsp; He
could lend money to the manager to enable him to go on, but that would be
at best hazardous, and could never do it in the complete manner in which he
wished to establish it.&nbsp; In this period of consideration, Mr.
Fitzmaurice was advised by his friends never to engage in so complex a
business as a manufacture, in which he must of necessity become a merchant,
also engage in all the hazard, irksomeness, etc., of commerce, so totally
different from his birth, education, ideas, and pursuits; but tired with
the inactivity of common life, he determined not only to turn manufacturer,
but to carry on the business in the most spirited and vigorous manner that
was possible.&nbsp; In the first place he took every means of making
himself a complete master of the business; he went through various
manufactures, inquired into the minuti&aelig;, and took every measure to
know it to the bottom.&nbsp; This he did so repeatedly and with such
attention in the whole progress, from spinning to bleaching and selling,
that he became as thorough a master of it as an experienced manager; he has
wove <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>linen, and done every part of the business with his own
hands.&nbsp; As he determined to have the works complete, he took Mr.
Stansfield the engineer, so well known for his improved saw-mills, into his
pay.&nbsp; He sent him over to Ballymoat in the winter of 1774, in order to
erect the machinery of a bleach mill upon the very best construction; he
went to all the great mills in the north of Ireland to inspect them, to
remark their deficiencies, that they might be improved in the mills he
intended to erect.&nbsp; This knowledge being gained, the work was begun,
and as water was necessary, a great basin was formed by a dam across a
valley, by which means thirty-four acres were floated, to serve as a
reservoir for dry seasons, to secure plenty at all times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>August 30.&nbsp; Rode to Rosshill, four miles off, a headland that
projects into the Bay of Newport, from which there is a most beautiful view
of the bay on both sides; I counted thirty islands very distinctly, all of
them cultivated under corn and potatoes, or pastured by cattle.&nbsp; At a
distance Clare rises in a very bold and picturesque style; on the left Crow
Patrick, and to the right other mountains.&nbsp; It is a view that wants
nothing but wood.</p>
<p>September 5.&nbsp; To Drumoland, the seat of Sir Lucius O&rsquo;Brien,
in the county of Clare, a gentleman who had been repeatedly assiduous to
procure me every sort of information.&nbsp; I should remark, as I have now
left <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>Galway, that that county, from entering it in the road to Tuam
till leaving it to-day, has been, upon the whole, inferior to most of the
parts I have travelled in Ireland in point of beauty: there are not
mountains of a magnitude to make the view striking.&nbsp; It is perfectly
free from woods, and even trees, except about gentlemen&rsquo;s houses, nor
has it a variety in its face.&nbsp; I do not, however, speak without
exception; I passed some tracts which are cheerful.&nbsp; Drumoland has a
pleasing variety of grounds about the house; it stands on a hill gently
rising from a lake of twenty-four acres, in the middle of a noble wood of
oak, ash, poplar, etc.; three beautiful hills rise above, over which the
plantations spread in a varied manner; and these hills command very fine
views of the great rivers Fergus and Shannon at their junction, being each
of them a league wide.</p>
<p>There is a view of the Shannon from Limerick to Foynes Island, which is
thirty miles, with all its bays, bends, islands, and fertile shores.&nbsp;
It is from one to three miles broad, a most noble river, deserving regal
navies for its ornament, or, what are better, fleets of merchantmen, the
cheerful signs of far-extended commerce, instead of a few miserable
fishing-boats, the only canvas that swelled upon the scene; but the want of
commerce in her ports is the misfortune not the fault of
Ireland&mdash;thanks for the deficiency to that illiberal spirit of trading
jealousy, which has at times actuated and disgraced so many nations.&nbsp;
The prospect <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>has a noble outline in the bold mountains of Tipperary, Cork,
Limerick, and Kerry.&nbsp; The whole view magnificent.</p>
<p>At the foot of this hill is the castle of Bunratty, a very large
edifice, the seat of the O&rsquo;Briens, princes of Thomond; it stands on
the bank of a river, which falls into the Shannon near it.&nbsp; About this
castle and that of Rosmanagher the land is the best in the county of Clare;
it is worth &pound;1 13s. an acre, and fats a bullock per acre in summer,
besides winter feed.</p>
<p>To Limerick, through a cheerful country, on the banks of the river, in a
vale surrounded by distant mountains.&nbsp; That city is very finely
situated, partly on an island formed by the Shannon.&nbsp; The new part,
called Newtown Pery, from Mr. Pery the speaker, who owns a considerable
part of the city, and represents it in Parliament, is well built.&nbsp; The
houses are new ones, of brick, large, and in right lines.&nbsp; There is a
communication with the rest of the town by a handsome bridge of three large
arches erected at Mr. Pery&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; Here are docks, quays,
and a custom-house, which is a good building, faces the river, and on the
opposite banks is a large quadrangular one, the house of industry.&nbsp;
This part of Limerick is very cheerful and agreeable, and carries all the
marks of a flourishing place.</p>
<p>The exports of this port are beef, pork, butter, hides, and
rape-seed.&nbsp; The imports are rum, sugar, timber, <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>tobacco, wines, coals,
bark, salt, etc.&nbsp; The customs and excise, about sixteen years ago,
amounted to &pound;16,000, at present &pound;32,000, and rather more four
or five years ago.</p>

<p>Land sells at twenty years&rsquo; purchase.&nbsp; Rents were at the
highest in 1765; fell since, but in four years have fallen 8s. to 10s. an
acre about Limerick.&nbsp; They are at a stand at present, owing to the
high price of provisions from pasture.&nbsp; The number of people in <!--
page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Limerick
is computed at thirty-two thousand; it is exceedingly populous for the
size, the chief street quite crowded; many sedan chairs in town, and some
hackney chaises.&nbsp; Assemblies the year round, in a new assembly-house
built for the purpose, and plays and concerts common.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, Limerick must be a very gay place, but when the usual
number of troops are in town much more so.&nbsp; To show the general
expenses of living, I was told of a person&rsquo;s keeping a carriage, four
horses, three men, three maids, a good table, a wife, three children, and a
nurse, and all for &pound;500 a year:</p>

<p>A barrel of beef or pork, 200lb. weight.&nbsp; Vessels of 400 tons can
come up with spring tides, which rise fourteen feet.</p>
<p>September 9.&nbsp; To Castle Oliver; various country, not so rich to
appearance as the Caucasus, being fed bare; much hilly sheep walk, and for
a considerable way a full third of it potatoes and corn: no sign of
depopulation.&nbsp; Just before I got to the hills a field of ragwort
(<i>senesio jacob&oelig;a</i>) buried the cows.&nbsp; The first hill of
Castle Oliver interesting.&nbsp; After rising a <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>mountain so high that
no one could think of any house, you come in view of a vale, quite filled
with fine woods, fields margined with trees, and hedge plantations climbing
up the mountains.&nbsp; Having engaged myself to Mr. Oliver, to return from
Killarney by his house, as he was confined to Limerick by the assizes, I
shall omit saying anything of it at present.</p>
<p>September 16.&nbsp; To Cove by water, from Mr. Trent&rsquo;s quay.&nbsp;
The view of Lota is charming; a fine rising lawn from the water, with noble
spreading woods reaching on each side; the house a very pleasing front,
with lawn shooting into the woods.&nbsp; The river forms a creek between
two hills, one Lota, the other opening to another hill of inclosures well
wooded.&nbsp; As the boat leaves the shore nothing can be finer than the
view behind us; the back woods of Lota, the house and lawn, and the high
bold inclosures towards Cork, form the finest shore imaginable, leading to
Cork, the city appearing in full view, Dunkettle wooded inclosures, a fine
sweep of hill, joining Mr. Hoare&rsquo;s at Factory Hill, whose woods have
a beautiful effect.&nbsp; Dunkettle House almost lost in a wood.&nbsp; As
we advance, the woods of Lota and Dunkettle unite in one fine mass.&nbsp;
The sheet of water, the rising lawns, the house in the most beautiful
situation imaginable, with more woods above it than lawns below it, the
west shore of Loch Mahon, a very fine rising hill cut into inclosures but
without wood, land-locked on every side with high <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>lands, scattered with
inclosures, woods, seats, etc., with every cheerful circumstance of lively
commerce, have altogether a great effect.&nbsp; Advancing to Passage the
shores are various, and the scenery enlivened by fourscore sail of large
ships; the little port of Passage at the water&rsquo;s edge, with the hills
rising boldly above it.&nbsp; The channel narrows between the great island
and the hills of Passage.&nbsp; The shores bold, and the ships scattered
about them, with the inclosures hanging behind the masts and yards
picturesque.&nbsp; Passing the straits a new basin of the harbour opens,
surrounded with high lands.&nbsp; Monkstown Castle on the hill to the
right, and the grounds of Ballybricken, a beautiful intermixed scene of
wood and lawn.&nbsp; The high shore of the harbour&rsquo;s mouth opens
gradually.&nbsp; The whole scene is land-locked.&nbsp; The first view of
Haulbowline Island and Spike Island, high rocky lands, with the channel
opening to Cove, where are a fleet of ships at anchor, and Rostellan, Lord
Inchiquin&rsquo;s house, backed with hills, a scenery that wants nothing
but the accompaniment of wood.&nbsp; The view of Ballybricken changes; it
now appears to be unfortunately cut into right lines.&nbsp; Arrived at the
ship at Cove; in the evening returned, leaving Mr. Jefferys and family on
board for a voyage to Havre, in their way to Paris.</p>
<p>Dunkettle is one of the most beautiful places I have seen in
Ireland.&nbsp; It is a hill of some hundred acres <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>broken into a great
variety of ground by gentle declivities, with everywhere an undulating
outline and the whole varied by a considerable quantity of wood, which in
some places is thick enough to take the appearance of close groves, in
others spreads into scattered thickets and a variety of single
groups.&nbsp; This hill, or rather cluster of hills, is surrounded on one
side by a reach of Cork Harbour, over which it looks in the most
advantageous manner; and on the other by an irriguous vale, through which
flows the river Glanmire; the opposite shore of that river has every
variety that can unite to form pleasing landscapes for the views from
Dunkettle grounds; in some places narrow glens, the bottoms of which are
quite filled with water, and the steep banks covered with thick woods that
spread a deep shade; in others the vale opens to form the site of a pretty
cheerful village, overhung by hill and wood: here the shore rises gradually
into large inclosures, which spread over the hills, stretching beyond each
other; and there the vale melts again into a milder variety of
fields.&nbsp; A hill thus situated, and consisting in itself of so much
variety of surface, must necessarily command many pleasing views.&nbsp; To
enjoy these to the better advantage, Mr. Trent (than whom no one has a
better taste, both to discover and describe the beauties of natural scenes)
is making a walk around the whole, which is to bend to the inequalities of
the ground, so as to take the <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>principal points in view.&nbsp; The whole is so
beautiful, that if I were to make the regular detour, the description might
be too minute; but there are some points which gave me so much pleasure
that I know not how to avoid recommending to others that travel this way to
taste the same satisfaction.&nbsp; From the upper part of the orchard you
look down a part of the river, where it opens into a regular basin, one
corner stretching up to Cork, lost behind the hill of Lota, the lawn of
which breaks on the swelling hills among the woods; the house obscured, and
therefore seeming a part of your home scene; the losing the river behind
the beautiful projection of Lota is more pleasing than can be
expressed.&nbsp; The other reach, leading to the harbour&rsquo;s mouth, is
half hidden by the trees, which margin the foot of the hill on which you
stand; in front a noble range of cultivated hills, the inclosures broken by
slight spots of wood, and prettily varied with houses, without being so
crowded as to take off the rural effect.&nbsp; The scene is not only
beautiful in those common circumstances which form a landscape, but is
alive with the cheerfulness of ships and boats perpetually moving.&nbsp;
Upon the whole, it is one of the most luxuriant prospects I have anywhere
seen.&nbsp; Leaving the orchard, pass on the brow of a hill which forms the
bank of the river of Glanmire, commanding the opposite woods of Lota in all
their beauty.&nbsp; Rise to the top of the high hill which joins the deer
park, and exhibits a <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>scene equally extensive and beautiful; you look
down on a vale which winds almost around at your feet, finishing to the
left in Cork river, which here takes the appearance of a lake, bounded by
wood and hills, and sunk in the bottom of a vale, in a style which painting
cannot imitate; the opposite hills of Lota, wood, and lawn, seem formed as
objects for this point of view: at your feet a hill rises out of the vale,
with higher ones around it, the margins scattered wood; to the right,
towards Riverstown, a vale; the whole backed by cultivated hills to
Kallahan&rsquo;s field.&nbsp; Milder scenes follow: a bird&rsquo;s-eye view
of a small vale sunk at your feet, through which the river flows; a bridge
of several arches unites two parts of a beautiful village, the meadow
grounds of which rise gently, a varied surface of wood and lawn, to the
hills of Riverstown, the whole surrounded by delicious sweeps of cultivated
hills.&nbsp; To the left a wooded glen rising from the vale to the horizon,
the scenery sequestered, but pleasing; the oak wood which hangs on the
deer-park hills, an addition.&nbsp; Down to the brow of the hill, where it
hangs over the river, a picturesque interesting spot.&nbsp; The inclosures
of the opposite bank hang beautifully to the eye, and the wooded glen winds
up the hill.&nbsp; Returning to the house I was conducted to the hill,
where the grounds slope off to the river of Cork, which opens to view in
noble reaches of a magnitude that fills the eye and the imagination; a
whole country of a character truly <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>magnificent, and behind
the winding vale which leads between a series of hills to Glanmire.</p>

<p>September 17.&nbsp; To Castlemartyr, the seat of the Earl <!-- page
79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of Shannon, one
of the most distinguished improvers in Ireland; in whom I found the most
earnest desire to give me every species of information, with a knowledge
and ability which enabled him to do it most effectually.&nbsp; Passed
through Middleton, a well-built place, which belongs to the noble lord to
whom it gives title.&nbsp; Castlemartyr is an old house, but much added to
by the present earl; he has built, besides other rooms, a dining one
thirty-two feet long by twenty-two broad, and a drawing one, the best rooms
I have seen in Ireland, a double cube of twenty-five feet, being fifty
long, twenty-five broad, and twenty-five high.&nbsp; The grounds about the
house are very well laid out; much wood well grown, considerable lawns, a
river made to wind through them in a beautiful manner, an old castle so
perfectly covered with ivy as to be a picturesque object.&nbsp; A winding
walk leads for a considerable distance along the banks of this river, and
presents several pleasing landscapes.</p>
<p>From Rostellan to Lota, the seat of Frederick Rogers, Esq.&nbsp; I had
before seen it in the highest perfection from the water going from
Dunkettle to Cove, and from the grounds of Dunkettle.&nbsp; Mrs. Rogers was
so obliging as to show me the back grounds, which are admirably wooded, and
of a fine varied surface.</p>
<p>Got to Cork in the evening, and waited on the Dean, who received me with
the most flattering attention.&nbsp; Cork is one of the most populous
places I have <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>ever been in; it was market-day, and I could scarce drive through
the streets, they were so amazingly thronged: on the other days the number
is very great.&nbsp; I should suppose it must resemble a Dutch town, for
there are many canals in the streets, with quays before the houses.&nbsp;
The best built part is Morrison&rsquo;s Island, which promises well; the
old part of the town is very close and dirty.&nbsp; As to its commerce, the
following particulars I owe to Robert Gordon, Esq., the
surveyor-general:</p>

yard; if they might export to 8s. they are very clear that they could get a
great trade for the woollen manufactures of Cork.&nbsp; The wool comes from
Galway and Roscommon, combed here by combers, who earn 8s. to 10s. a week,
into balls of twenty-four ounces, which is spun into worsteds of twelve
skeins to the ball, and exported to Yarmouth for Norwich; the export price,
&pound;30 a pack to &pound;33, never before so high; average of them,
&pound;26 to &pound;30.&nbsp; Some they work up at home into serges,
stuffs, and camlets; the serges at 12d. a yard, thirty-four inches wide;
the stuffs sixteen inches, at 18d., the camlets at 9&frac12;d. to 13d.; the
spinners at 9d. a ball, one in a week; or a ball and half 12d. a week, and
attend the family besides; this is done most in Waterford and Kerry,
particularly near Killarney; the weavers earn 1s. a day on an
average.&nbsp; Full three-fourths of the wool is exported in yarn, and only
one-fourth worth worked up.&nbsp; Half the wool of Ireland is combed in the
county of Cork.</p>
<p>A very great manufacture of ratteens at Carrick-on-Suir; the bay worsted
is for serges, shalloons, etc.&nbsp; Woollen yarn for coarse cloths, which
latter have been lost for some years, owing to the high price of
wool.&nbsp; The bay export has declined since 1770, which declension is
owing to the high price of wool.</p>
<p>No wool smuggled, not even from Kerry; not a sloop&rsquo;s cargo in
twenty years, the price too high; the declension has been
considerable.&nbsp; For every <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>eighty-six packs that are exported, a licence
from the Lord Lieutenant, for which &pound;20 is paid.</p>
<p>From the Act of the last sessions of Great Britain for exporting woollen
goods for the troops in the pay of Ireland, Mr. Abraham Lane, of Cork,
established a new manufacture of army clothing for that purpose, which is
the first at Cork, and pays &pound;40 a week in labour only.&nbsp; Upon the
whole there has been no increase of woollen manufacture within twenty
years.&nbsp; Is clearly of opinion that many fabrics might be worked up
here much cheaper than in France, of cloths that the French have beat the
English out of; these are, particularly, broadcloths of one yard and half
yard wide, from 3s. to 6s. 6d. a yard for the Levant trade.&nbsp; Friezes
which are now supplied from Carcassone in Languedoc.&nbsp; Friezes, of
twenty-four to twenty-seven inches, at 10d. to 13d. a yard.&nbsp; Flannels,
twenty-seven to thirty-six, from 7d. to 14d.&nbsp; Serges of twenty-seven
to thirty-six inches, at 7d. to 12d. a yard; these would work up the coarse
wool.&nbsp; At Ballynasloe Fair, in July, &pound;200,000 a year bought in
wool.&nbsp; There is a manufactory of knit-stocking by the common women
about Cork, for eight or ten miles around; the yarn from 12d. to 18d. a
pair, and the worsted from 16d. to 20d., and earn from 12d. to 18d. a
week.&nbsp; Besides their own consumption, great quantities are sent to the
north of Ireland.</p>
<p>All the weavers in the country are confined to towns, <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>have no land, but small
gardens.&nbsp; Bandle, or narrow linen, for home consumption, is made in
the western part of the county.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the circumstances
of all the manufacturing poor are better than they were twenty years
ago.&nbsp; The manufactures have not declined, though the exportation has,
owing to the increased home consumptions.&nbsp; Bandon was once the seat of
the stuff, camlet, and shag manufacture, but has in seven years declined
above three-fourths.&nbsp; Have changed it for the manufacture of coarse
green linens, for the London market, from 6d. to 9d. a yard, twenty-seven
inches wide; but the number of manufactures in general much lessened.</p>
<p>Rode to the mouth of Cork Harbour; the grounds about it are all fine,
bold, and varied, but so bare of trees, that there is not a single view but
what pains one in the want of wood.&nbsp; Rents of the tract south of the
river Caragoline, from 5s. to 30s.; average, 10s.&nbsp; Not one man in five
has a cow, but generally from one to four acres, upon which they have
potatoes, and five or six sheep, which they milk, and spin their
wool.&nbsp; Labour 5d. in winter, 6d. in summer; many of them for three
months in the year live on potatoes and water, the rest of it they have a
good deal of fish.&nbsp; But it is remarked, at Kinsale, that when sprats
are most plentiful, diseases are most common.&nbsp; Rent for a mere cabin,
10s.&nbsp; Much paring and burning; paring twenty-eight men a day, sow
wheat on it and then potatoes; <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>get great crops.&nbsp; The soil a sharp, stony
land; no limestone south of the above river.&nbsp; Manure for potatoes,
with sea-weed, for 26s., which gives good crops, but lasts only one
year.&nbsp; Sea-sand much used; no shells in it.&nbsp; Farms rise to two or
three hundred acres, but are hired in partnership.</p>
<p>Before I quit the environs of Cork, I must remark that the country on
the harbour I think preferable, in many respects, for a residence, to
anything I have seen in Ireland.&nbsp; First, it is the most southerly part
of the kingdom.&nbsp; Second, there are very great beauties of
prospect.&nbsp; Third, by much the most animated, busy scene of shipping in
all Ireland, and consequently, fourth, a ready price for every
product.&nbsp; Fifth, great plenty of excellent fish and wild fowl.&nbsp;
Sixth, the neighbourhood of a great city for objects of convenience.</p>
<p>September 25.&nbsp; Took the road to Nedeen, through the wildest region
of mountains that I remember to have seen; it is a dreary but an
interesting road.&nbsp; The various horrid, grotesque, and unusual forms in
which the mountains rise and the rocks bulge; the immense height of some
distant heads, which rear above all the nearer scenes, the torrents roaring
in the vales, and breaking down the mountain sides, with here and there a
wretched cabin, and a spot of culture yielding surprise to find human
beings the inhabitants of such a scene of wildness, altogether keep the
traveller&rsquo;s mind <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>in an agitation and suspense.&nbsp; These rocks
and mountains are many of them no otherwise improvable than by planting,
for which, however, they are exceedingly well adapted.</p>
<p>Sir John Colthurst was so obliging as to send half a dozen labourers
with me, to help my chaise up a mountain side, of which he gave a
formidable account: in truth it deserved it.&nbsp; The road leads directly
against a mountain ridge, and those who made it were so incredibly stupid,
that they kept the straight line up the hill, instead of turning aside to
the right to wind around a projection of it.&nbsp; The path of the road is
worn by torrents into a channel, which is blocked up in places by huge
fragments, so that it would be a horrid road on a level; but on a hill so
steep, that the best path would be difficult to ascend&mdash;it may be
supposed terrible: the labourers, two passing strangers, and my servant,
could with difficulty get the chaise up.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted
that the direction of the road is not changed, as all the rest from Cork to
Nedeen is good enough.&nbsp; For a few miles towards the latter place the
country is flat on the river Kenmare, much of it good, and under grass or
corn.&nbsp; Passed Mr. Orpine&rsquo;s at Ardtilly, and another of the same
name at Killowen.</p>
<p>Nedeen is a little town, very well situated, on the noble river Kenmare,
where ships of one hundred and fifty tons may come up; there are but three
or four <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>good houses.&nbsp; Lord Shelburne, to whom the place belongs, has
built one for his agent.&nbsp; There is a vale of good land, which is here
from a mile and a half to a mile broad; and to the north and south, great
ridges of mountains said to be full of mines.</p>
<p>At Nedeen, Lord Shelburne had taken care to have me well informed by his
people in that country, which belongs for the greatest part to himself, he
has above one hundred and fifty thousand Irish acres in Kerry; the greatest
part of the barony of Glanrought belongs to him, most of Dunkerron and
Ivragh.&nbsp; The country is all a region of mountains, inclosed by a vale
of flat land on the river; the mountains to the south come to the
water&rsquo;s edge, with but few variations, the principal of which is
Ardee, a farm of Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s to the north of the river, the flat
land is one-half to three-quarters of a mile broad.&nbsp; The mountains to
the south reach to Bear-haven, and those to the north to Dingle Bay; the
soil is extremely various; to the south of the river all are sandstones,
and the hills loam, stone, gravel, and bog.&nbsp; To the north there is a
slip of limestone land, from Kilgarvon to Cabbina-cush, that is six miles
east of Nedeen, and three to the west, but is not more than a quarter of a
mile broad, the rest, including the mountains, all sandstone.&nbsp; As to
its rents, it is very difficult to tell what they are; for land is let by
the plough-land and gineve, twelve gineves to the plough-land; but the
latter <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>denomination is not of any particular quantity, for no two
plough-lands are the same.&nbsp; The size of farms is various, from forty
acres to one thousand; less quantities go with cabins, and some farms are
taken by labourers in partnership.</p>
<p>Soon entered the wildest and most romantic country I had anywhere seen;
a region of steep rocks and mountains which continued for nine or ten
miles, till I came in view of Mucruss.&nbsp; There is something
magnificently wild in this stupendous scenery, formed to impress the mind
with a certain species of terror.&nbsp; All this tract has a rude and
savage air, but parts of it are strikingly interesting; the mountains are
bare and rocky, and of a great magnitude; the vales are rocky glens, where
a mountain stream tumbles along the roughest bed imaginable, and receives
many torrents, pouring from clefts, half overhung with shrubby wood; some
of these streams are seen, and the roar of others heard, but hid by vast
masses of rock.&nbsp; Immense fragments, torn from the precipices by storms
and torrents, are tumbled in the wildest confusion, and seem to hang rather
than rest upon projecting precipices.&nbsp; Upon some of these fragments of
rock, perfectly detached from the soil, except by the side on which they
lie, are beds of black turf, with luxuriant crops of heath, etc., which
appeared very curious to me, having nowhere seen the like; and I observed
very high in the mountains&mdash;much higher than any <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>cultivation is at
present, on the right hand&mdash;flat and cleared spaces of good grass
among the ridges of rock, which had probably been cultivated, and proved
that these mountains were not incapable from climate of being applied to
useful purposes.</p>
<p>From one of these heights I looked forward to the Lake of Killarney at a
considerable distance, and backward to the river Kenmare; came in view of a
small part of the upper lake, spotted with several islands, and surrounded
by the most tremendous mountains that can be imagined, of an aspect savage
and dreadful.&nbsp; From this scene of wild magnificence, I broke at once
upon all the glories of Killarney; from an elevated point of view I looked
down on a considerable part of the lake, which gave me a specimen of what I
might expect.&nbsp; The water you command (which, however, is only a part
of the lake) appears a basin of two or three miles round; to the left it is
inclosed by the mountains you have passed, particularly by the Turk, whose
outline is uncommonly noble, and joins a range of others, that form the
most magnificent shore in the world: on the other side is a rising scenery
of cultivated hills, and Lord Kenmare&rsquo;s park and woods; the end of
the lake at your feet is formed by the root of Mangerton, on whose side the
road leads.&nbsp; From hence I looked down on a pretty range of inclosures
on the lake, and the woods and lawns of Mucruss, forming a large promontory
of thick wood, shooting <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>far into the lake.&nbsp; The most active fancy
can sketch nothing in addition.&nbsp; Islands of wood beyond seem to join
it, and reaches of the lake, breaking partly between, give the most lively
intermixture of water; six or seven isles and islets form an accompaniment:
some are rocky, but with a slight vegetation, others contain groups of
trees, and the whole thrown into forms, which would furnish new ideas to a
painter.&nbsp; Farther is a chain of wooded islands, which also appear to
join the mainland, with an offspring of lesser ones scattered around.</p>
<p>Arrived at Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s at Mucruss, to whose friendly attention I
owed my succeeding pleasure.&nbsp; There have been so many descriptions of
Killarney written by gentlemen who have resided some time there, and seen
it at every season, that for a passing traveller to attempt the like would
be in vain; for this reason I shall give the mere journal of the remarks I
made on the spot, in the order I viewed the lake.</p>
<p>September 27.&nbsp; Walked into Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s beautiful grounds,
to Oroch&rsquo;s Hill, in the lawn that he has cleared from that profusion
of stones which lie under the wall; the scene which this point commands is
truly delicious; the house is on the edge of the lawn, by a wood which
covers the whole peninsula, fringes the slope at your feet, and forms a
beautiful shore to the lake.&nbsp; Tomys and Glen&aacute; are vast
mountainous <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>masses of incredible magnificence, the outline soft and easy in
its swells, whereas those above the eagle&rsquo;s nest are of so broken and
abrupt an outline, that nothing can be imagined more savage, an aspect
horrid and sublime, that gives all the impressions to be wished to astonish
rather than please the mind.&nbsp; The Turk exhibits noble features, and
Mangerton&rsquo;s huge body rises above the whole.&nbsp; The cultivated
tracts towards Killarney form a shore in contrast to the terrific scenes I
have just mentioned; the distant boundary of the lake, a vast ridge of
distant blue mountains towards Dingle.&nbsp; From hence entered the garden,
and viewed Mucruss Abbey, one of the most interesting scenes I ever saw; it
is the ruin of a considerable abbey, built in Henry VI.&rsquo;s time, and
so entire, that if it were more so, though the building would be more
perfect, the ruin would be less pleasing; it is half obscured in the shade
of some venerable ash trees; ivy has given the picturesque circumstance,
which that plant alone can confer, while the broken walls and ruined
turrets throw over it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The last mournful graces of decay;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>heaps of skulls and bones scattered about, with nettles, briars, and
weeds sprouting in tufts from the loose stones, all unite to raise those
melancholy impressions, which are the merit of such scenes, and which can
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>scarcely anywhere be felt more completely.&nbsp; The cloisters
form a dismal area, in the centre of which grows the most prodigious
yew-tree I ever beheld, in one great stem, two feet diameter, and fourteen
feet high, from whence a vast head of branches spreads on every side, so as
to perform a perfect canopy to the whole space.&nbsp; I looked for its fit
inhabitant; it is a spot where</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The moping owl doth to the moon complain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ruin is in the true style in which all such buildings should
appear; there is not an intruding circumstance, the hand of dress has not
touched it, melancholy is the impression which such scenes should kindle,
and it is here raised most powerfully.</p>
<p>From the abbey we passed to the terrace, a natural one of grass, on the
very shore of the lake; it is irregular and winding; a wall of rocks broken
into fantastic forms by the waves: on the other side a wood, consisting of
all sorts of plants, which the climate can protect, and through which a
variety of walks are traced.&nbsp; The view from this terrace consists of
many parts of various characters, but in their different styles complete;
the lake opens a spreading sheet of water, spotted by rocks and islands,
all but one or two wooded; the outlines of them are sharp and distinct;
nothing can be more smiling than this scene, soft and mild, a perfect
contrast of beauty to the sublimity of <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the mountains which
form the shore: these rise in an outline, so varied, and at the same time
so magnificent, that nothing greater can be imagined; Tomys and
Glen&aacute; exhibit an immensity in point of magnitude, but from a large
hanging wood on the slope, and from the smoothness of the general surface,
it has nothing savage, whereas the mountains above and near the
eagle&rsquo;s nest are of the most broken outlines; the declivities are
bulging rocks, of immense size, which seem to impend in horrid forms over
the lake, and where an opening among them is caught, others of the same
rude character rear their threatening heads.&nbsp; From different parts of
the terrace these scenes are viewed in numberless varieties.</p>
<p>Returned to breakfast, and pursued Mr. Herbert&rsquo;s new road, which
he has traced through the peninsula to Dynis Island, three miles in length;
and it is carried in so judicious a manner through a great variety of
ground, rocky woods, lawns, etc., that nothing can be more pleasing; it
passes through a remarkable scene of rocks, which are covered with
woods.&nbsp; From thence to the marble quarry, which Mr. Herbert is
working, and where he gains variety of marbles, green, red, white, and
brown, prettily veined; the quarry is a shore of rocks, which surround a
bay of the lake, and forms a scene consisting of but few parts, but those
strongly marked; the rocks are bold, and broken into slight caverns; they
are fringed with <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>scattered trees, and from many parts of them
wood shoots in that romantic manner so common at Killarney.&nbsp; Full in
front Turk Mountain rises with the proudest outline, in that abrupt
magnificence which fills up the whole space before one, and closes the
scene.</p>
<p>The road leads by a place where copper-mines were worked; many shafts
appear; as much ore was raised as sold for twenty-five thousand pounds, but
the works were laid aside, more from ignorance in the workmen than any
defects in the mine.</p>
<p>Came to the opening on the great lake, which appears to advantage here,
the town of Killarney on the north-east shore.&nbsp; Look full on the
mountain Glen&aacute;, which rises in very bold manner, the hanging woods
spread half way, and are of great extent, and uncommonly beautiful.&nbsp;
Two very pleasing scenes succeed; that to the left is a small bay, hemmed
in by a neck of land in front; the immediate shore rocks, which are in a
picturesque style, and crowned entirely with arbutus, and other wood; a
pretty retired scene, where a variety of objects give no fatigue to the
eye.&nbsp; The other is an admirable mixture of the beautiful and sublime:
a bare rock of an almost regular figure projects from a headland into the
lake, which, with much wood and highland, forms one side of the scene; the
other is wood from a rising ground only; the lake open between, in a sheet
of no great extent, but in <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>front is the hanging wood of Glen&aacute;,
which appears in full glory.</p>
<p>Mr. Herbert has built a handsome Gothic bridge, to unite the peninsula
to the island of Brickeen, through the arch of which the waters of the
north and south lake flow.&nbsp; It is a span of twenty-seven feet, and
seventeen high, and over it the road leads to that island.&nbsp; From
thence to Brickeen nearly finished, and it is to be thrown across a bottom
into Dynis.</p>
<p>Returned by the northern path through a thick wood for some distance,
and caught a very agreeable view of Ash Island, seen through an opening,
inclosed on both sides with wood.&nbsp; Pursued the way from these grounds
to Keelbeg, and viewed the bay of the Devil&rsquo;s Island, which is a
beautiful one, inclosed by a shore, to the right of very noble rocks in
ledges and other forms, crowned in a striking manner with wood; a little
rocky islet rises in front; to the left the water opens, and Turk Mountain
rises with that proud superiority which attends him in all these
scenes.</p>
<p>The view of the promontory of Dindog, near this place, closes this part
of the lake, and is indeed singularly beautiful.&nbsp; It is a large rock,
which shoots far into the water, of a height sufficient to be interesting,
in full relief, fringed with a scanty vegetation; the shore on which you
stand bending to the right, as if to meet that rock, presents a circular
shade of dark wood: Turk still the background, in a character of <!-- page
97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>great
sublimity, and Mangerton&rsquo;s loftier summit, but less interesting
outline, a part of the scenery.&nbsp; These views, with others of less
moment, are connected by a succession of lawns breaking among the wood,
pleasing the eye with lively verdure, and relieving it from the fatigue of
the stupendous mountain scenes.</p>
<p>September 28.&nbsp; Took boat on the lake, from the promontory of Dindog
before mentioned.&nbsp; I had been under a million of apprehensions that I
should see no more of Killarney; for it blew a furious storm all night, and
in the morning the bosom of the lake heaved with agitation, exhibiting few
marks but those of anger.&nbsp; After breakfast it cleared up, the clouds
dispersed by degrees, the waves subsided, the sun shone out in all its
splendour; every scene was gay, and no ideas but pleasure possessed the
breast.&nbsp; With these emotions sallied forth, nor did they disappoint
us.</p>
<p>Rowed under the rocky shore of Dindog, which is romantic to a great
degree.&nbsp; The base, by the beating of the waves, is worn into caverns,
so that the heads of the rocks project considerably beyond the base, and
hang over in a manner which makes every part of it interesting.&nbsp;
Following the coast, open marble quarry bay, the shore great fragments of
rock tumbled about in the wildest manner.</p>
<p>The island of rocks against the copper-mine shore a remarkable
group.&nbsp; The shore near Casemilan is of a <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>different nature; it is
wood in some places, in unbroken masses down to the water&rsquo;s edge, in
others divided from it by smaller tracts of rock.&nbsp; Come to a beautiful
land-locked bay, surrounded by a woody shore, which, opening in places,
shows other woods more retired.&nbsp; Tomys is here viewed in a unity of
form, which gives it an air of great magnificence.&nbsp; Turk was obscured
by the sun shining immediately above him, and, casting a stream of burning
light on the water, displayed an effect to describe which the pencil of a
Claude alone would be equal.&nbsp; Turn out of the bay, and gain a full
view of the Eagle&rsquo;s Nest, the mountains above it, and Glen&aacute;;
they form a perfect contrast; the first are rugged, but Glen&aacute;
mild.&nbsp; Here the shore is a continued wood.</p>
<p>Pass the bridge, and cross to Dynis, an island Mr. Herbert has improved
in the most agreeable manner, by cutting walks through it that command a
variety of views.&nbsp; One of these paths on the banks of the channel to
the upper lake is sketched with great taste; it is on one side walled with
natural rocks, from clefts of which shoot a thousand fine arbutuses, that
hang in a rich foliage of flowers and scarlet berries; a turf bench in a
delicious spot; the scene close and sequestered, just enough to give every
pleasing idea annexed to retirement.</p>
<p>Passing the bridge, by a rapid stream, came presently to the
Eagle&rsquo;s Nest: having viewed this rock <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>from places where it
appears only a part of an object much greater than itself, I had conceived
an idea that it did not deserve the applause given it, but upon coming near
I was much surprised; the approach is wonderfully fine, the river leads
directly to its foot, and does not give the turn till immediately under, by
which means the view is much more grand than it could otherwise be; it is
nearly perpendicular, and rises in such full majesty, with so bold an
outline, and such projecting masses in its centre, that the magnificence of
the object is complete.&nbsp; The lower part is covered with wood, and
scattered trees climb almost to the top, which (if trees can be amiss in
Ireland) rather weaken the impression raised by this noble rock.&nbsp; This
part is a hanging wood, or an object whose character is perfect beauty; but
the upper scene, the broken outline, rugged sides, and bulging masses, all
are sublime, and so powerful, that sublimity is the general impression of
the whole, by overpowering the idea of beauty raised by the wood.&nbsp;
This immense height of the mountains of Killarney may be estimated by this
rock; from any distant place that commands it, it appears the lowest crag
of a vast chain, and of no account; but on a close approach it is found to
command a very different respect.</p>
<p>Pass between the mountains called the Great Range, towards the upper
lake.&nbsp; Here Turk, which has so long appeared with a figure perfectly
interesting, is <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>become, from a different position, an
unmeaning lump.&nbsp; The rest of the mountains, as you pass, assume a
varied appearance, and are of a prodigious magnitude.&nbsp; The scenery in
this channel is great and wild in all its features; wood is very scarce;
vast rocks seem tossed in confusion through the narrow vale, which is
opened among the mountains for the river to pass.&nbsp; Its banks are rocks
in a hundred forms; the mountain-sides are everywhere scattered with
them.&nbsp; There is not a circumstance but is in unison with the wild
grandeur of the scene.</p>
<p>Coleman&rsquo;s Eye, a narrow pass, opens a different scenery.&nbsp;
Came to a region in which the beautiful and the great are mixed without
offence.&nbsp; The islands are most of them thickly wooded.&nbsp; Oak Isle
in particular rises on a pretty base, and is a most beautiful object:
Macgillicuddy Reeks, with their broken points; Baum, with his perfect cone;
the Purple Mountain, with his broad and more regular head; and Turk, having
assumed a new and more interesting aspect, unite with the opposite hills,
part of which have some wood left on them, to form a scene uncommonly
striking.&nbsp; Here you look back on a very peculiar spot; it is a parcel
of rocks which cross the lake, and form a gap that opens to distant water,
the whole backed by Turk, in a style of the highest grandeur.</p>
<p>Come to Derry Currily, which is a great sweep of mountain, covered
partly with wood, hanging in a very <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>noble manner, but
part cut down, much of it mangled, and the rest inhabited by coopers,
boat-builders, carpenters, and turners, a sacrilegious tribe, who have
turned the Dryads from their ancient habitations.&nbsp; The cascade here is
a fine one; but passed quickly from hence to scenes unmixed with pain.</p>
<p>Row to the cluster of the Seven Islands, a little archipelago; they rise
very boldly from the water upon rocky bases, and are crowned in the most
beautiful manner with wood, among which are a number of arbutuses; the
channels among them opening to new scenes, and the great amphitheatre of
rock and mountain that surround them unite to form a noble view.</p>
<p>Into the river, at the very end of the lake, which winds towards
Macgillicuddy Reeks in fanciful meanders.</p>
<p>Returned by a course somewhat different, through the Seven Islands, and
back to the Eagle&rsquo;s Nest, viewing the scenes already mentioned in new
positions.&nbsp; At that noble rock fired three cannon for the echo, which
indeed is prodigious; the report does not consist of direct reverberations
from one rock to another with a pause between, but has an exact resemblance
to a peal of thunder rattling behind the rock, as if travelling the whole
scenery we had viewed, and lost in the immensity of Macgillicuddy
Reeks.</p>
<p>Returning through the bridge, turn to the left round Dynis Island, under
the woods of Glen&aacute;; open on the <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>cultivated country
beyond the town of Killarney, and come gradually in sight of Innisfallen
and Ross Island.</p>
<p>Pass near to the wood of Glen&aacute;, which here takes the appearance
of one immense sweep hanging in the most beautiful manner imaginable, on
the side of a vast mountain to a point, shooting into the great lake.&nbsp;
A more glorious scene is not to be imagined.&nbsp; It is one deep mass of
wood, composed of the richest shades perfectly dipping in the water,
without rock or strand appearing, not a break in the whole.&nbsp; The eye
passing upon the sheet of liquid silver some distance, to meet so entire a
sweep of every tint that can compose one vast mass of green, hanging to
such an extent as to fill not only the eye but the imagination, unites in
the whole to form the most noble scene that is anywhere to be beheld.</p>
<p>Turn under the north shore of Mucruss; the lake here is one great
expanse of water, bounded by the woods described, the islands of
Innisfallen, Ross, etc., and the peninsula.&nbsp; The shore of Mucruss has
a great variety; it is in some places rocky; huge masses tumbled from their
base lie beneath, as in a chaos of ruin.&nbsp; Great caverns worn under
them in a variety of strange forms; or else covered with woods of a variety
of shades.&nbsp; Meet the point of Ardnagluggen (in English where the water
dashes on the rocks) and come under Ornescope, a rocky headland of a most
bold projection <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>hanging many yards over its base, with an old
weather-beaten yew growing from a little bracket of rock, from which the
spot is called Ornescope, or yew broom.</p>
<p>Mucruss gardens presently open among the woods, and relieve the eye,
almost fatigued with the immense objects upon which it has so long gazed;
these softer scenes of lawn gently swelling among the shrubs and trees
finished the second day.</p>
<p>September 29.&nbsp; Rode after breakfast to Mangerton Cascade and
Drumarourk Hill, from which the view of Mucruss is uncommonly pleasing.</p>
<p>Pass the other hill, the view of which I described the 27th, and went to
Colonel Huffy&rsquo;s monument, from whence the scene is different from the
rest; the foreground is a gentle hill, intersected by hedges, forming
several small lawns.&nbsp; There are some scattered trees and houses, with
Mucruss Abbey half obscured by wood, the whole cheerful and backed by
Turk.&nbsp; The lake is of a triangular form, Ross Island and Innisfallen
its limits; the woods of Mucruss and the islands take a new position.</p>
<p>Returning, took a boat again towards Ross Isle, and as Mucruss retires
from us, nothing can be more beautiful than the spots of lawn in the
terrace opening in the wood; above it the green hills with clumps, and the
whole finishing in the noble group of wood about the abbey, which here
appears a deep shade, and so fine a finishing one, that not a tree should
be touched.&nbsp; <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Rowed to the east point of Ross, which is well
wooded; turn to the south coast.&nbsp; Doubling the point, the most
beautiful shore of that island appears; it is the well-wooded environs of a
bay, except a small opening to the castle; the woods are in deep shades,
and rise on the regular slopes of a high range of rocky coast.&nbsp; The
part in front of Filekilly point rises in the middle, and sinks towards
each end.&nbsp; The woods of Tomys here appear uncommonly fine.&nbsp; Open
Innisfallen, which is composed at this distance of the most various shades,
within a broken outline, entirely different from the other islands, groups
of different masses rising in irregular tufts, and joined by lower
trees.&nbsp; No pencil could mix a happier assemblage.&nbsp; Land near a
miserable room, where travellers dine.&nbsp; Of the isle of Innisfallen, it
is paying no great compliment to say it is the most beautiful in the
king&rsquo;s dominions, and perhaps in Europe.&nbsp; It contains twenty
acres of land, and has every variety that the range of beauty, unmixed with
the sublime, can give.&nbsp; The general feature is that of wood; the
surface undulates into swelling hills, and sinks into little vales; the
slopes are in every direction, the declivities die gently away, forming
those slight inequalities which are the greatest beauty of dressed
grounds.&nbsp; The little valleys let in views of the surrounding lake
between the hills, while the swells break the regular outline of the water,
and give to the whole an agreeable confusion.&nbsp; The wood has all the
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>variety into which nature has thrown the surface; in some parts
it is so thick as to appear impenetrable, and secludes all farther view; in
others, it breaks into tufts of tall timber, under which cattle feed.&nbsp;
Here they open, as if to offer to the spectator the view of the naked lawn;
in others close, as if purposely to forbid a more prying examination.&nbsp;
Trees of large size and commanding figure form in some places natural
arches; the ivy mixing with the branches, and hanging across in festoons of
foliage, while on one side the lake glitters among the trees, and on the
other a thick gloom dwells in the recesses of the wood.&nbsp; The figure of
the island renders one part a beautiful object to another; for the coast
being broken and indented, forms bays surrounded either with rock or wood:
slight promontories shoot into the lake, whose rocky edges are crowned with
wood.&nbsp; These are the great features of Innisfallen; the slighter
touches are full of beauties easily imagined by the reader.&nbsp; Every
circumstance of the wood, the water, the rocks, and lawn, are
characteristic, and have a beauty in the assemblage from mere
disposition.&nbsp; I must, however, observe that this delicious retreat is
not kept as one could wish.</p>
<p>Scenes that are great and commanding, from magnitude or wildness, should
never be dressed; the rugged, and even the horrible, may add to the effect
upon the mind: but in such as Innisfallen, a degree of dress, that is,
cleanliness, is even necessary to beauty.&nbsp; I <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>have spoken of lawn,
but I should observe that expression indicates what it ought to be rather
than what it is.&nbsp; It is very rich grass, poached by oxen and cows, the
only inhabitants of the island.&nbsp; No spectator of taste but will regret
the open grounds not being drained with hollow cuts; the ruggedness of the
surface levelled, and the grass kept close shaven by many sheep instead of
beasts.&nbsp; The bushes and briars, where they have encroached on what
ought to be lawn, cleared away; some parts of the isle more opened; in a
word no ornaments given, for the scene wants them not, but obstructions
cleared, ruggedness smoothed, and the whole cleaned.&nbsp; This is what
ought to be done; as to what might be made of the island, if its noble
proprietor (Lord Kenmare) had an inclination, it admits of being converted
into a terrestrial paradise; lawning with the intermixture of other shrubs
and wood, and a little dress, would make it an example of what ornamented
grounds might be, but which not one in a thousand is.&nbsp; Take the
island, however, as it is, with its few imperfections, and where are we to
find such another?&nbsp; What a delicious retreat! an emperor could not
bestow such a one as Innisfallen; with a cottage, a few cows, and a swarm
of poultry, is it possible that happiness should refuse to be a guest
here?</p>
<p>Row to Ross Castle, in order to coast that island; there is nothing
peculiarly striking in it; return the same way around Innisfallen.&nbsp; In
this little voyage <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the shore of Ross is one of the most beautiful
of the wooded ones in the lake; it seems to unite with Innisfallen, and
projects into the water in thick woods one beyond another.&nbsp; In the
middle of the channel a large rock, and from the other shore a little
promontory of a few scattered trees; the whole scene pleasing.</p>
<p>The shore of Innisfallen has much variety, but in general it is woody,
and of the beautiful character which predominates in that island.&nbsp; One
bay, at taking leave of it, is exceedingly pretty; it is a semicircular
one, and in the centre there is a projecting knoll of wood within a bay;
this is uncommon, and has an agreeable effect.</p>
<p>The near approach to Tomys exhibits a sweep of wood, so great in extent,
and so rich in foliage, that no person can see without admiring it.&nbsp;
The mountainous part above is soon excluded by the approach; wood alone is
seen, and that in such a noble range as to be greatly striking; it just
hollows into a bay, and in the centre of it is a chasm in the wood; this is
a bed of a considerable stream, which forms O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s
cascade, to which all strangers are conducted, as one of the principal
beauties of Killarney.&nbsp; Landed to the right of it, and walked under
the thick shade of the wood, over a rocky declivity, close to the torrent
stream, which breaks impetuously from rock to rock, with a roar that
kindles expectation.&nbsp; The picture in your fancy will not exceed the
reality; a great stream <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>bursts from the deep bosom of a wooded glen,
hollowed into a retired recess of rocks and trees, itself a most pleasing
and romantic spot, were there not a drop of water: the first fall is many
feet perpendicularly over a rock; to the eye it immediately makes another,
the basin into which it pours being concealed; from this basin it forces
itself impetuously between two rocks.&nbsp; This second fall is also of a
considerable height; but the lower one, the third, is the most
considerable; it issues in the same manner from a basin hid from the point
of view.&nbsp; These basins being large, there appears a space of several
yards between each fall, which adds much to the picturesque scenery; the
whole is within an arch of wood, that hangs over it; the quantity of water
is so considerable, as to make an almost deafening noise, and uniting with
the torrent below, where the fragments of rock are large and numerous,
throw an air of grandeur over the whole.&nbsp; It is about seventy feet
high.&nbsp; Coast from hence the woody shores of Tomys and Glen&aacute;;
they are upon the whole much the most beautiful ones I have anywhere seen;
Glen&aacute; woods having more oak, and some arbutuses, are the finer and
deeper shades; Tomys has a great quantity of birch, whose foliage is not so
luxuriant.&nbsp; The reader may figure to himself what these woods are,
when he is informed that they fill an unbroken extent of six miles in
length, and from half a mile to a mile and a half in breadth, all hanging
on the <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>sides of two vast mountains, and coming down with a full robe of
rich luxuriance to the very water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; The acclivity of
these hills is such, that every tree appears full to the eye.&nbsp; The
variety of the ground is great; in some places great swells in the
mountain-side, with corresponding hollows, present concave and convex
masses; in others, considerable ridges of land and rock rise from the
sweep, and offer to the astonished eye yet other varieties of shade.&nbsp;
Smaller mountains rise regularly from the immense bosom of the larger, and
hold forth their sylvan heads, backed by yet higher woods.&nbsp; To give
all the varieties of this immense scenery of forest is impossible.&nbsp;
Above the whole is a prodigious mass of mountain, of a gently swelling
outline and soft appearance, varying as the sun or clouds change their
position, but never becoming rugged or threatening to the eye.</p>
<p>The variations are best seen by rowing near the shore, when every stroke
of the oar gives a new outline, and fresh tints to please the eye: but for
one great impression, row about two miles from the shore of Glen&aacute;;
at that distance the inequalities in the surface are no longer seen, but
the eye is filled with so immense a range of wood, crowned with a mountain
in perfect unison with itself, that objects, whose character is that of
beauty, are here, from their magnitude, truly magnificent, and attended
with a most forcible expression.&mdash;Returned to Mucruss.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>September 30.&nbsp; This morning I had dedicated to the ascent of
Mangerton, but his head was so enshrouded in clouds, and the weather so
bad, that I was forced to give up the scheme: Mr. Herbert has measured him
with very accurate instruments, of which he has a great collection, and
found his height eight hundred and thirty-five yards above the level of the
sea.&nbsp; The Devil&rsquo;s Punch-bowl, from the description I had of it,
must be the crater of an exhausted volcano: there are many signs of them
about Killarney, particularly vast rocks on the sides of mountains, in
streams, as if they had rolled from the top in one direction.&nbsp; Brown
stone rocks are also sometimes found on lime-quarries, tossed thither
perhaps in some vast eruption.</p>
<p>In my way from Killarney to Castle Island, rode into Lord
Kenmare&rsquo;s park, from whence there is another beautiful view of the
lake, different from many of the preceding; there is a broad margin of
cultivated country at your feet, to lead the eye gradually in the lake,
which exhibits her islands to this point more distinctly than to any other,
and the backgrounds of the mountains of Glen&aacute; and Tomys give a bold
relief.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, Killarney, among the lakes that I have seen, can
scarcely be said to have a rival.&nbsp; The extent of water in Loch Earne
is much greater, the islands more numerous, and some scenes near Castle
Caldwell of perhaps as great magnificence.&nbsp; The rocks <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>at Keswick
are more sublime, and other lakes may have circumstances in which they are
superior; but when we consider the prodigious woods of Killarney, the
immensity of the mountains, the uncommon beauty of the promontory of
Mucruss and the Isle of Innisfallen, the character of the islands, the
singular circumstance of the arbutus, and the uncommon echoes, it will
appear, upon the whole, to be in reality superior to all comparison.</p>
<p>Before I quit it I have one other observation to make, which is relative
to the want of accommodations and extravagant expense of strangers residing
at Killarney.&nbsp; I speak it not at all feelingly, thanks to Mr.
Herbert&rsquo;s hospitality, but from the accounts given me: the inns are
miserable, and the lodgings little better.&nbsp; I am surprised somebody
with a good capital does not procure a large well-built inn, to be erected
on the immediate shore of the lake, in an agreeable situation, at a
distance from the town; there are very few places where such a one would
answer better; there ought to be numerous and good apartments.&nbsp; A
large rendezvous-room for billiards, cards, dancing, music, etc., to which
the company might resort when they chose it; an ordinary for those that
like dining in public; boats of all sorts, nets for fishing, and as great a
variety of amusements as could be collected, especially within doors; for
the climate being very rainy, travellers wait with great impatience in a
dirty <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>common inn, which they would not do if they were in the midst of
such accommodations as they meet with at an English spa.&nbsp; But above
all, the prices of everything, from a room and a dinner to a barge and a
band of music, to be reasonable, and hung up in every part of the
house.&nbsp; The resort of strangers to Killarney would then be much
increased, and their stay would be greatly prolonged; they would not view
it post-haste, and fly away the first moment to avoid dirt and
imposition.&nbsp; A man with a good capital and some ingenuity would, I
think, make a fortune by fixing here upon such principles.</p>
<p>The state of the poor in the whole county of Kerry represented as
exceedingly miserable, and owing to the conduct of men of property, who are
apt to lay the blame on what they call land pirates, or men who offer the
highest rent, and who, in order to pay this rent, must and do re-let all
the cabin lands at an extravagant rise, which is assigning over all the
cabins to be devoured by one farmer.&nbsp; The cottars on a farm cannot go
from one to another, in order to find a good master, as in England; for all
the country is in the same system, and no redress to be found.&nbsp; Such
being the case, the farmers are enabled to charge the price of labour as
low as they please, and rate the land as high as they like.&nbsp; This is
an evil which oppresses them cruelly, and certainly has its origin in its
landlords when they set their farms, setting all the cabins with <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>them,
instead of keeping them tenants to themselves.&nbsp; The oppression is, the
farmer valuing the labour of the poor at fourpence or fivepence a day, and
paying that in land rated much above its value.&nbsp; Owing to this the
poor are depressed; they live upon potatoes and sour milk, and the poorest
of them only salt and water to them, with now and then a herring.&nbsp;
Their milk is bought; for very few keep cows, scarce any pigs, but a few
poultry.&nbsp; Their circumstances are incomparably worse than they were
twenty years ago; for they had all cows, but then they wore no linen: all
now have a little flax.&nbsp; To these evils have been owing emigrations,
which have been considerable.</p>
<p>To the west of Tralee are the Mahagree Islands, famous for their corn
products; they are rock and sand, stocked with rabbits; near them a sandy
tract, twelve miles long, and one mile broad, to the north, with the
mountains to the south, famous for the best wheat in Kerry; all under the
plough.</p>
<p>Arriving at Ardfert, Lord Crosby, whose politeness I have every reason
to remember, was so obliging as to carry me by one of the finest strands I
ever rode upon, to view the mouth of the Shannon at Ballengary, the site of
an old fort.&nbsp; It is a vast rock, separated from the country by a chasm
of prodigious depth, through which the waves drive.&nbsp; The rocks of the
coast here are in the boldest style, and hollowed by the furious Atlantic
waves into caverns in which they roar.&nbsp; It <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>was a dead calm, yet
the swell was so heavy, that the great waves rolled in and broke upon the
rocks with such violence as to raise an immense foam, and give one an idea
of what a storm would be; but fancy rarely falls short in her
pictures.&nbsp; The view of the Shannon is exceedingly noble; it is eight
miles over, the mouth formed by two headlands of very high and bold cliffs,
and the reach of the river in view very extensive; it is an immense
scenery: perhaps the noblest mouth of a river in Europe.</p>
<p>Ardfert is very near the sea, so near it that single trees or rows are
cut in pieces with the wind, yet about Lord Glendour&rsquo;s house there
are extensive plantations exceedingly flourishing, many fine ash and beech;
about a beautiful Cistercian abbey, and a silver fir of forty-eight
years&rsquo; growth, of an immense height and size.</p>
<p>October 3.&nbsp; Left Ardfert, accompanying Lord Crosby to
Listowel.&nbsp; Called in the way to view Lixnaw, the ancient seat of the
Earls of Kerry, but deserted for ten years past, and now presents so
melancholy a scene of desolation, that it shocked me to see it.&nbsp;
Everything around lies in ruin, and the house itself is going fast off by
thieving depredations of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I was told a curious
anecdote of this estate; which shows wonderfully the improvement of
Ireland.&nbsp; The present Earl of Kerry&rsquo;s grandfather, Thomas,
agreed to lease the whole estate for &pound;1,500 a year to a <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Mr. Collis
for ever, but the bargain went off upon a dispute whether the money should
be paid at Cork or Dublin.&nbsp; Those very lands are now let at
&pound;20,000 a year.&nbsp; There is yet a good deal of wood, particularly
a fine ash grove, planted by the present Earl of Shelburne&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>Proceeded to Woodford, Robert Fitzgerald&rsquo;s, Esq., passing Listowel
Bridge; the vale leading to it is very fine, the river is broad, the lands
high, and one side a very extensive hanging wood, opening on those of
Woodford in a pleasing style.</p>
<p>Woodford is an agreeable scene; close to the house is a fine winding
river under a bank of thick wood, with the view of an old castle hanging
over it.</p>
<p>In 1765, Mr. Fitzgerald was travelling from Constantinople to Warsaw,
and a waggon with his baggage heavily laden overset; the country people
harnessed two buffaloes by the horns, in order to draw it over, which they
did with ease.&nbsp; In some very instructive conversation I had with this
gentleman on the subject of his travels, this circumstance particularly
struck me.</p>
<p>October 4.&nbsp; From Woodford to Tarbat, the seat of Edward Leslie,
Esq., through a country rather dreary, till it came upon Tarbat, which is
so much the contrary that it appeared to the highest advantage; the house
is on the edge of a beautiful lawn, with a thick margin of full grown wood,
hanging on a steep bank <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>to the Shannon, so that the river is seen from
the house over the tops of this wood, which being of a broken irregular
outline has an effect very striking and uncommon; the river is two or three
miles broad here, and the opposite coast forms a promontory which has from
Tarbat exactly the appearance of a large island.&nbsp; To the east, the
river swells into a triangular lake, with a reach opening at the distant
corner of it to Limerick.&nbsp; The union of wood, water, and lawn forms
upon the whole a very fine scene; the river is very magnificent.&nbsp; From
the hill on the coast above the island, the lawn and wood appear also to
great advantage.&nbsp; But the finest point of view is from the higher hill
on the other side of the house, which looking down on all these scenes,
they appear as a beautiful ornament to the Shannon, which spreads forth its
proud course from two to nine miles wide, surrounded by highlands; a
scenery truly magnificent.</p>
<p>The state of the poor is something better than it was twenty years ago,
particularly their clothing, cattle, and cabins.&nbsp; They live upon
potatoes and milk; all have cows, and when they dry them, buy others.&nbsp;
They also have butter, and most of them keep pigs, killing them for their
own use.&nbsp; They have also herrings.&nbsp; They are in general in the
cottar system, of paying for labour by assigning some land to each
cabin.&nbsp; The country is greatly more populous than twenty years ago,
and is now increasing; and if ever <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>so many cabins were
built by a gradual increase, tenants would be found for them.&nbsp; A cabin
and five acres of land will let for &pound;4 a year.&nbsp; The industrious
cottar, with two, three, or four acres, would be exceedingly glad to have
his time to himself, and have such an annual addition of land as he was
able to manage, paying a fair rent for it; none would decline it but the
idle and worthless.</p>
<p>Tithes are all annually valued by the proctors, and charged very
high.&nbsp; There are on the Shannon about one hundred boats employed in
bringing turf to Limerick from the coast of Kerry and Clare, and in
fishing; the former carry from twenty to twenty-five tons, the latter from
five to ten, and are navigated each by two men and a boy.</p>
<p>October 5.&nbsp; Passed through a very unentertaining country (except
for a few miles on the bank of the Shannon) to Altavilla, but Mr. Bateman
being from home, I was disappointed in getting an account of the palatines
settled in his neighbourhood.&nbsp; Kept the road to Adair, where Mrs.
Quin, with a politeness equalled only by her understanding, procured me
every intelligence I wished for.</p>
<p>Palatines were settled here by the late Lord Southwell about seventy
years ago.</p>
<p>They preserve some of their German customs: sleep between two
beds.&nbsp; They appoint a burgomaster, to whom they appeal in case of all
disputes; <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>and they yet preserve their language, but that is
declining.&nbsp; They are very industrious, and in consequence are much
happier and better fed, clothed, and lodged than the Irish peasants.&nbsp;
We must not, however, conclude from hence that all is owing to this; their
being independent farmers, and having leases, are circumstances which will
create industry.&nbsp; Their crops are much better than those of their
neighbours.&nbsp; There are three villages of them, about seventy families
in all.&nbsp; For some time after they settled they fed upon sour-crout,
but by degrees left it off, and took to potatoes; but now subsist upon them
and butter and milk, but with a great deal of oat bread, and some of wheat,
some meat and fowls, of which they raise many.&nbsp; They have all offices
to their houses, that is, stables and cow-houses, and a lodge for their
ploughs, etc.&nbsp; They keep their cows in the house in winter, feeding
them upon hay and oat straw.&nbsp; They are remarkable for the goodness and
cleanliness of their houses.&nbsp; The women are very industrious, reap the
corn, plough the ground sometimes, and do whatever work may be going on;
they also spin, and make their children do the same.&nbsp; Their wheat is
much better than any in the country, insomuch that they get a better price
than anybody else.&nbsp; Their industry goes so far, that jocular reports
of its excess are spread.&nbsp; In a very pinching season, one of them
yoked his wife against a horse, and went in that manner to work, and <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>finished a journey at plough.&nbsp; The industry of the women is
a perfect contrast to the Irish ladies in the cabins, who cannot be
persuaded, on any consideration, even to make hay, it not being the custom
of the country, yet they bind corn, and do other works more
laborious.&nbsp; Mrs. Quin, who is ever attentive to introduce whatever can
contribute to their welfare and happiness, offered many premiums to induce
them to make hay, of hats, cloaks, stockings, etc. etc., but all would not
do.</p>
<p>Few places have so much wood about them as Adair; Mr. Quin has above one
thousand acres in his hands, in which a large proportion is under
wood.&nbsp; The deer park of four hundred acres is almost full of old oak
and very fine thorns, of a great size; and about the house, the plantations
are very extensive, of elm and other wood, but that thrives better than any
other sort.&nbsp; I have nowhere seen finer than vast numbers here.&nbsp;
There is a fine river runs under the house, and within view are no less
than three ruins of Franciscan friaries, two of them remarkably beautiful,
and one has most of the parts perfect, except the roof.</p>
<p>In Mr. Quin&rsquo;s house there are some very good pictures,
particularly an Annunciation by Domenichino, which is a beautiful
piece.&nbsp; It was brought lately from Italy by Mr. Quin, junior.&nbsp;
The colours are rich and mellow, and the hairs of the heads inimitably
pleasing; the group of angels at the top, to the left of the piece, <!--
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>is very
natural.&nbsp; It is a piece of great merit.&nbsp; The companion is a
Magdalen; the expression of melancholy, or rather misery, remarkably
strong.&nbsp; There is a gloom in the whole in full unison with the
subject.&nbsp; There are, besides these, some others inferior, yet of
merit, and two very good portraits of Lord Dartry (Mrs. Quin&rsquo;s
brother), and of Mr. Quin, junior, by Pompeio Battoni.&nbsp; A piece in an
uncommon style, done on oak, of Esther and Ahasuerus; the colours tawdry,
but the grouping attitudes and effect pleasing.</p>
<p>Castle Oliver is a place almost entirely of Mr. Oliver&rsquo;s creation;
from a house, surrounded with cabins and rubbish, he has fixed it in a fine
lawn, surrounded by good wood.&nbsp; The park he has very much improved on
an excellent plan; by means of seven feet hurdles, he fences off part of it
that wants to be cleaned or improved; these he cultivates, and leaves for
grass, and then takes another spot, which is by much the best way of doing
it.&nbsp; In the park is a glen, an English mile long, winding in a
pleasing manner, with much wood hanging on the banks.&nbsp; Mr. Oliver has
conducted a stream through this vale, and formed many little water-falls in
an exceedingly good taste, chiefly overhung with wood, but in some places
open with several little rills, trickling over stones down the
slopes.&nbsp; A path winds through a large wood and along the brow of the
glen; this path leads to a hermitage, a cave of rock, in a good taste, and
to some benches, <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>from which the views of the water and wood are
in the sequestered style they ought to be.&nbsp; One of these little views,
which catches several falls under the arch of the bridge, is one of the
prettiest touches of the kind I have seen.&nbsp; The vale beneath the
house, when viewed from the higher grounds, is pleasing; it is very well
wooded, there being many inclosures, surrounded by pine trees, and a thick
fine mass of wood rises from them up the mountain-side, makes a very good
figure, and would be better, had not Mr. Oliver&rsquo;s father cut it into
vistas for shooting.&nbsp; Upon the whole, the place is highly improved,
and when the mountains are planted, in which Mr. Oliver is making a
considerable progress, it will be magnificent.</p>
<p>In the house are several fine pictures, particularly five pieces by Seb.
Ricci, Venus and &AElig;neas; Apollo and Pan; Venus and Achilles; and
Pyrrhus and Andromache, by Lazzerini; and the Rape of the Lapithi by the
Centaurs.&nbsp; The last is by much the finest, and is a very capital
piece; the expression is strong, the figures are in bold relief, and the
colouring good.&nbsp; Venus and Achilles is a pleasing picture; the
continence of Scipio is well grouped, but Scipio, as in every picture I
ever saw of him, has no expression.&nbsp; Indeed, chastity is in the
countenance so passive a virtue as not to be at all suited to the genius of
painting; the idea is rather that of insipidity, and accordingly
Scipio&rsquo;s expression is generally insipid enough.&nbsp; Two fine
pieces, by Lucca <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Jordano, Hercules and Anteus; Samson Killing
the Lion: both dark and horrid, but they are highly finished and
striking.&nbsp; Six heads of old men, by Nagori, excellent; and four young
women, in the character of the seasons.</p>
<p>October 9.&nbsp; Left Castle Oliver.&nbsp; Had I followed my
inclination, my stay would have been much longer, for I found it equally
the residence of entertainment and instruction.&nbsp; Passed through
Kilfennan and Duntreleague, in my way to Tipperary.&nbsp; The road leads
everywhere on the sides of the hills, so as to give a very distinct view of
the lower grounds; the soil all the way is the same sort of sandy reddish
loam I have already described, incomparable land for tillage: as I advanced
it grew something lighter, and in many places free from gravel.&nbsp;
Bullocks the stock all the way.&nbsp; Towards Tipperary I saw vast numbers
of sheep, and many bullocks.&nbsp; All this line of country is part of the
famous golden vale.&nbsp; To Thomas Town, where I was so unfortunate as not
to find Mr. Matthew at home; the domain is one thousand five hundred
English acres, so well planted that I could hardly believe myself in
Ireland.&nbsp; There is a hill in the park from which the view of it, the
country and the Galties, are striking.</p>
<p>October 12.&nbsp; To Lord de Montalt&rsquo;s, at Dundrum, a place which
his lordship has ornamented in the modern style of improvement: the house
was situated in the midst of all the regular exertions of the last
age.&nbsp; <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>Parterres, parapets of earth, straight walks, knots and clipped
hedges, all which he has thrown down, with an infinite number of hedges and
ditches, filled up ponds, etc., and opened one very noble lawn around him,
scattered negligently over with trees, and cleared the course of a
choked-up river, so that it flows at present in a winding course through
the grounds.</p>
<p>October 13.&nbsp; Leaving Dundrum, passed through Cashel, where is a
rock and ruin on it, called the Rock of Cashel, supposed to be of the
remotest antiquity.&nbsp; Towards Clonmel, the whole way through the same
rich vein of red sandy loam I have so often mentioned: I examined it in
several fields, and found it to be of an extraordinary fertility, and as
fine turnip land as ever I saw.&nbsp; It is much under sheep; but towards
Clonmel there is a great deal of tillage.</p>
<p>The first view of that town, backed by a high ridge of mountains, with a
beautiful space near it of inclosures, fringed with a scattering of trees,
was very pleasing.&nbsp; It is the best situated place in the county of
Tipperary, on the Suir, which brings up boats of ten tons burthen.&nbsp; It
appears to be a busy populous place, yet I was told that the manufacture of
woollens is not considerable.&nbsp; It is noted for being the birthplace of
the inimitable Sterne.</p>
<p>To Sir William Osborne&rsquo;s, three miles the other side
Clonmel.&nbsp; From a character so remarkable for intelligence and
precision, I could not fail of <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>meeting information of the most valuable
kind.&nbsp; This gentleman has made a mountain improvement which demands
particular attention, being upon a principle very different from common
ones.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago he met with a hearty-looking fellow of forty, followed
by a wife and six children in rags, who begged.&nbsp; Sir William
questioned him upon the scandal of a man in full health and vigour,
supporting himself in such a manner: the man said he could get no work:
&ldquo;Come along with me, I will show you a spot of land upon which I will
build a cabin for you, and if you like it you shall fix there.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The fellow followed Sir William, who was as good as his word: he built him
a cabin, gave him five acres of a heathy mountain, lent him four pounds to
stock with, and gave him, when he had prepared his ground, as much lime as
he would come for.&nbsp; The fellow flourished; he went on gradually;
repaid the four pounds, and presently became a happy little cottar: he has
at present twelve acres under cultivation, and a stock in trade worth at
least &pound;80; his name is John Conory.</p>
<p>The success which attended this man in two or three years brought others
who applied for land, and Sir William gave them as they applied.&nbsp; The
mountain was under lease to a tenant, who valued it so little, that upon
being reproached with not cultivating, or doing something with it, he
assured Sir William that it was utterly impracticable to do anything with
it, and <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>offered it to him without any deduction of rent.&nbsp; Upon this
mountain he fixed them; gave them terms as they came determinable with the
lease of the farm, so that every one that came in succession had shorter
and shorter tenures; yet are they so desirous of settling, that they come
at present, though only two years remain for a term.</p>
<p>In this manner Sir William has fixed twenty-two families, who are all
upon the improving hand, the meanest growing richer; and find themselves so
well off, that no consideration will induce them to work for others, not
even in harvest: their industry has no bounds; nor is the day long enough
for the revolution of their incessant labour.&nbsp; Some of them bring turf
to Clonmel, and Sir William has seen Conory returning loaded with soap
ashes.</p>
<p>He found it difficult to persuade them to make a road to their village,
but when they had once done it, he found none in getting cross roads to it,
they found such benefit in the first.&nbsp; Sir William has continued to
give whatever lime they come for: and they have desired one thousand
barrels among them for the year 1766, which their landlord has accordingly
contracted for with his lime-burner, at 11d. a barrel.&nbsp; Their houses
have all been built at his expense, and done by contract at &pound;6 each,
after which they raise what little offices they want for themselves.</p>
<p>October 15.&nbsp; Left New Town, and keeping on the <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>banks of the Suir,
passed through Carrick to Curraghmore, the seat of the Earl of
Tyrone.&nbsp; This line of country, in point of soil, inferior to what I
have of late gone through: so that I consider the rich country to end at
Clonmel.</p>
<p>Emigrations from this part of Ireland principally to Newfoundland: for a
season they have &pound;18 or &pound;20 for their pay, and are maintained,
but they do not bring home more than &pound;7 to &pound;11.&nbsp; Some of
them stay and settle; three years ago there was an emigration of indented
servants to North Carolina of three hundred, but they were stopped by
contrary winds, etc.&nbsp; There had been something of this constantly, but
not to that amount.&nbsp; The oppression which the poor people have most to
complain of is the not having any tenures in their lands, by which means
they are entirely subject to their employers.</p>
<p>Manufactures here are only woollens.&nbsp; Carrick is one of the
greatest manufacturing towns in Ireland.&nbsp; Principally for ratteens,
but of late they have got into broadcloths, all for home consumption; the
manufacture increases, and is very flourishing.&nbsp; There are between
three and four hundred people employed by it in Carrick and its
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Curraghmore is one of the finest places in Ireland, or indeed that I
have anywhere seen.&nbsp; The house, which is large, is situated upon a
rising ground, in a vale surrounded by very bold hills, which rise in a
variety of <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>forms and offer to the eye, in rising through the grounds, very
noble and striking scenes.&nbsp; These hills are exceedingly varied, so
that the detour of the place is very pleasing.&nbsp; In order to see it to
advantage, I would advise a traveller to take the ride which Lord Tyrone
carried me.&nbsp; Passed through the deer-park wood of old oaks, spread
over the side of a bold hill, and of such an extent, that the scene is a
truly forest one, without any other boundary in view than what the stems of
trees offer from mere extent, retiring one behind another till they thicken
so much to the eye, under the shade of their spreading tops, as to form a
distant wall of wood.&nbsp; This is a sort of scene not common in Ireland;
it is a great extent alone that will give it.&nbsp; From this hill enter an
evergreen plantation, a scene which winds up the deer-park hill, and opens
on to the brow of it, which commands a most noble view indeed.&nbsp; The
lawns round the house appear at one&rsquo;s feet, at the bottom of a great
declivity of wood, almost everywhere surrounded by plantations.&nbsp; The
hills on the opposite side of the vale against the house consist of a large
lawn in the centre of the two woods, that to the right of an immense
extent, which waves over a mountain-side in the finest manner imaginable,
and lead the eye to the scenery on the left, which is a beautiful vale of
rich inclosures, of several miles extent, with the Suir making one great
reach through it, and a bold bend just before it enters a gap in the hills
towards <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>Waterford, and winds behind them; to the right you look over a
large plain, backed by the great Cummeragh Mountains.&nbsp; For a distinct
extent of view, the parts of which are all of a commanding magnitude, and a
variety equal to the number, very few prospects are finer than this.</p>
<p>From hence the boundary plantation extends some miles to the west and
north-west of the domain, forming a margin to the whole of different
growths, having been planted, by degrees, from three to sixteen
years.&nbsp; It is in general well grown, and the trees thriven
exceedingly, particularly the oak, beech, larch, and firs.&nbsp; It is very
well sketched, with much variety given to it.</p>
<p>Pass by the garden across the river which murmurs over a rocky bed, and
follow the riding up a steep hill, covered with wood from some breaks, in
which the house appears perfectly buried in a deep wood, and come out,
after a considerable extent of ride, into the higher lawn, which commands a
view of the scenery about the house; and from the brow of the hill the
water, which is made to imitate a river, has a good effect, and throws a
great air of cheerfulness over the scene, for from hence the declivity
below it is hid.&nbsp; But the view, which is the most pleasing from hence,
the finest at Curraghmore, and indeed one of the most striking that is
anywhere to be seen, is that of the hanging wood to the right of the house,
rising in so noble a sweep as perfectly to fill the eye, and leave the <!--
page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>fancy
scarce anything to wish: at the bottom is a small semicircular lawn, around
which flows the river, under the immediate shade of very noble oaks.&nbsp;
The whole wood rises boldly from the bottom, tree above tree, to a vast
height, of large oak.&nbsp; The masses of shade are but tints of one
colour; it is not chequered with a variety.&nbsp; There is a majestic
simplicity, a unity in the whole, which is attended with an uncommon
impression, and such as none but the most magnificent scenes can raise.</p>
<p>Descending from hence through the roads, the riding crosses the river,
and passes through the meadow which has such an effect in the preceding
scene, from which also the view is very fine, and leads home through a
continued and an extensive range of fine oak, partly on a declivity, at the
bottom of which the river murmurs its broken course.</p>
<p>Besides this noble riding, there is a very agreeable walk runs
immediately on the banks of the river, which is perfect in its style; it is
a sequestered line of wood, so high on the declivities in some places, and
so thick on the very edge in others, overspreading the river, that the
character of the scene is gloom and melancholy, heightened by the noise of
the water falling from stone to stone.&nbsp; There is a considerable
variety in the banks of it, and in the figures and growth of the wood, but
none that hurts the impression, which is well preserved throughout.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>October 17.&nbsp; Accompanied Lord Tyrone to Waterford; made some
inquiries into the state of their trade, but found it difficult, from the
method in which the custom-house books are kept, to get the details I
wished; but in the year following, having the pleasure of a long visit at
Ballycanvan, the seat of Cornelius Bolton, Esq., his son, the member for
the city, procured me every information I could wish, and that in so
liberal and polite a manner, that it would not be easy to express the
obligations I am under to both.&nbsp; In general, I was informed that the
trade of the place had increased considerably in ten years, both the
exports and imports&mdash;the exports of the products of pasturage, full
one-third in twelve years.&nbsp; That the staple trade of the place is the
Newfoundland trade.&nbsp; This is very much increased; there is more of it
here than anywhere.&nbsp; The number of people who go as passengers in the
Newfoundland ships is amazing: from sixty to eighty ships, and from three
thousand to five thousand annually.&nbsp; They come from most parts of
Ireland, from Cork, Kerry, etc.&nbsp; Experienced men will get eighteen to
twenty-five pounds for the season, from March to November.&nbsp; A man who
never went will have five to seven pounds and his passage, and others rise
to twenty pounds; the passage out they get, but pay home two pounds.&nbsp;
An industrious man in a year will bring home twelve to sixteen pounds with
him, and some more.&nbsp; A great point for them is to be able to carry
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>out all their slops, for everything there is exceedingly dear,
one or two hundred per cent. dearer than they can get them at home.&nbsp;
They are not allowed to take out any woollen goods but for their own
use.&nbsp; The ships go loaded with pork, beef, butter, and some salt; and
bring home passengers, or get freights where they can; sometimes rum.&nbsp;
The Waterford pork comes principally from the barony of Iverk, in Kilkenny,
where they fatten great numbers of large hogs; for many weeks together they
kill here three to four thousand a week, the price fifty shillings to four
pounds each; goes chiefly to Newfoundland.&nbsp; One was killed in Mr.
Penrose&rsquo;s cellar that weighed five hundredweight and a quarter, and
measured from the nose to the end of the tail nine feet four inches.</p>
<p>There is a foundry at Waterford for pots, kettles, weights, and all
common utensils; and a manufactory by Messrs. King and Tegent of anvils to
anchors, twenty hundredweight, etc., which employs forty hands.&nbsp;
Smiths earn from 6s. to 24s. a week.&nbsp; Nailers from 10s. to 12s.&nbsp;
And another less considerable.&nbsp; There are two sugar-houses, and many
salt-houses.&nbsp; The salt is boiled over lime-kilns.</p>
<p>There is a fishery upon the coast of Waterford, for a great variety of
fish, herrings particularly, in the mouth of Waterford Harbour, and two
years ago in such quantities there, that the tides left the ditches full of
them.&nbsp; There are some premium boats both <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>here and at
Dungarvan, but the quantity of herrings barrelled is not considerable.</p>
<p>The butter trade of Waterford has increased greatly for seven years
past; it comes from Waterford principally, but much from Carlow; for it
comes from twenty miles beyond Carlow, for sixpence per hundred.&nbsp; From
the 1st of January, 1774, to the 1st of January, 1775, there were exported
fifty-nine thousand eight hundred and fifty-six casks of butter, each, on
an average, one hundredweight, at the mean price of 50s.&nbsp; Revenue of
Waterford, 1751, &pound;17,000; 1776, &pound;52,000.&nbsp; The slaughter
trade has increased, but not so much as the butter.&nbsp; Price of butter
now at Waterford, 58s.; twenty years&rsquo; average, 42s.&nbsp; Beef now to
25s.; average, twenty years, 10s. to 18s.&nbsp; Pork, now 30s.; average,
twenty years, 16s. to 22s.&nbsp; Eighty sail of ships now belonging to the
port, twenty years ago not thirty.&nbsp; They pay to the captains of ship
of two hundred tons &pound;5 a month; the mate &pound;3 10s.&nbsp; Ten men
at 40s., five years ago only 27s.&nbsp; Building ships, &pound;10 a
ton.&nbsp; Wear and tear of such a ship, &pound;20 a month.&nbsp; Ship
provisions, 20s. a month.</p>
<p>The new church in this city is a very beautiful one; the body of it is
in the same style exactly as that of Belfast, already described: the total
length one hundred and seventy feet, the breadth fifty-eight.&nbsp; The
length of the body of the church ninety-two, the height forty; breadth
between the pillars, twenty-six.&nbsp; The aisle <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>(which I do not
remember at Belfast) is fifty-eight by forty-five.&nbsp; A room on one side
the steeple, space for the bishop&rsquo;s court, twenty-four by eighteen;
on the other side, a room of the same size for the vestry; and twenty-eight
feet square left for a steeple when their funds will permit.&nbsp; The
whole is light and beautiful.&nbsp; It was built by subscription, and there
is a fine organ bespoke at London.&nbsp; But the finest object in this city
is the quay, which is unrivalled by any I have seen.&nbsp; It is an English
mile long; the buildings on it are only common houses, but the river is
near a mile over, flows up to the town in one noble reach, and the opposite
shore a bold hill, which rises immediately from the water to a height that
renders the whole magnificent.&nbsp; This is scattered with some wood, and
divided into pastures of a beautiful verdure by hedges.&nbsp; I crossed the
water, in order to walk up the rocks on the top of this hill.&nbsp; In one
place, over against Bilberry quarry, you look immediately down on the
river, which flows in noble reaches from Granny Castle on the right past
Cromwell&rsquo;s rock, the shores on both sides quite steep, especially the
rock of Bilberry.&nbsp; You look over the whole town, which here appears in
a triangular form.&nbsp; Besides the city the Cummeragh mountains,
Slein-a-man, etc., come in view.&nbsp; Kilmacow river falls into the Suir,
after flowing through a large extent of well-planted country.&nbsp; This is
the finest view about the city.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>From Waterford to Passage, and got my chaise and horses on board
the <i>Countess of Tyrone</i> packet, in full expectation of sailing
immediately, as the wind was fair, but I soon found the difference of these
private vessels and the Post-Office packets at Holyhead and Dublin.&nbsp;
When the wind was fair the tide was foul; and when the tide was with them
the wind would not do.&nbsp; In English, there was not a complement of
passengers, and so I had the agreeableness of waiting with my horses in the
hold, by way of rest, after a journey of above one thousand five hundred
miles.</p>
<p>October 18.&nbsp; After a beastly night passed on shipboard, and finding
no signs of departure, walked to Ballycanvan, the seat of Cornelius Bolton,
Esq.; rode with Mr. Bolton, jun., to Faithleghill, which commands one of
the finest views I have seen in Ireland.&nbsp; There is a rock on the top
of a hill which has a very bold view on every side down on a great extent
of country, much of which is grass inclosures of a good verdure.&nbsp; This
hill is the centre of a circle of about ten miles diameter, beyond which
higher lands rise, which, after spreading to a great extent, have on every
side a background of mountain: in a northerly direction Mount Leinster,
between Wexford and Wicklow, twenty-six miles off, rises in several heads
far above the clouds.&nbsp; A little to the right of this, Sliakeiltha
(<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the woody mountain&rdquo;), at a less distance, is a
fine object.&nbsp; To the left, Tory Hill, only five miles, in a regular
form, varies <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>the outline.&nbsp; To the east, there is the Long Mountain,
eighteen miles distant, and several lesser Wexford hills.&nbsp; To the
south-east, the Saltees.&nbsp; To the south, the ocean, and the Colines
about the bay of Tramore.&nbsp; To the west, Monavollagh rises two thousand
one hundred and sixty feet above the level of the sea, eighteen miles off,
being part of the great range of the Cummeragh mountains: and to the
north-west Slein-a-man, at the distance of twenty-four miles; so that the
outline is everywhere bold and distinct, though distant.&nbsp; These
circumstances would alone form a great view, but the water part of it,
which fills up the canvas, is in a much superior style.&nbsp; The great
river Suir takes a winding course from the city of Waterford, through a
rich country, hanging on the sides of hills to its banks, and, dividing
into a double channel, forms the lesser island, both of which courses you
command distinctly.&nbsp; United, it makes a bold reach under the hill on
which you stand, and there receives the noble tribute of the united waters
of the Barrow and Nore in two great channels, which form the larger
island.&nbsp; Enlarged by such an accession of water, it winds round the
hill in a bending course, of the freest and most graceful outline,
everywhere from one to three miles across, with bold shores that give a
sharp outline to its course to the ocean.&nbsp; Twenty sail of ships at
Passage gave animation to the scene.&nbsp; Upon the whole, the boldness of
the mountain outline, the variety of <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the grounds, the vast
extent of river, with the declivity to it from the point of view,
altogether form so unrivalled a scenery, every object so commanding, that
the general want of wood is almost forgotten.</p>
<p>Two years after this account was written I again visited this enchanting
hill, and walked to it, day after day, from Ballycanvan, and with
increasing pleasure.&nbsp; Mr. Bolton, jun., has, since I was there before,
inclosed forty acres on the top and steep slope to the water, and begun to
plant them.&nbsp; This will be a prodigious addition; for the slope forming
the bold shore for a considerable space, and having projections from which
the wood will all be seen in the gentle hollows of the hill, the effect
will be amazingly fine.&nbsp; Walks and a riding are tracing out, which
will command fresh beauties at every step.&nbsp; The spots from which a
variety of beautiful views are seen are numerous.&nbsp; All the way from
Ballycanvan to Faithleg, the whole, to the amount of one thousand two
hundred acres, is the property of Mr. Bolton.</p>
<p>Farms about Ballycanvan, Waterford, etc., are generally small, from
twenty and thirty to five hundred acres, generally about two hundred and
fifty.&nbsp; All above two hundred acres are in general dairies; some of
the dairy ones rise very high.&nbsp; The soil is a reddish stony or slaty
gravel, dry, except low lands, which are clay or turf.&nbsp; Rents vary
much&mdash;about the town very high, from &pound;5 5s. to &pound;9, but at
the distance <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>of a few miles towards Passage, etc., they are from 20s. to 40s.,
and some higher, but the country in general does not rise so high, usually
10s. to 20s. for dairying land.</p>
<p>The poor people spin their own flax, but not more, and a few of them
wool for themselves.&nbsp; Their food is potatoes and milk; but they have a
considerable assistance from fish, particularly herrings; part of the year
they have also barley, oaten, and rye bread.&nbsp; They are incomparably
better off in every respect than twenty years ago.&nbsp; Their increase
about Ballycanvan is very great, and tillage all over this neighbourhood is
increased.&nbsp; The rent of a cabin 10s.; an acre with it 20s.&nbsp; The
grass of a cow a few years ago 20s., now 25s. or 30s.</p>
<p>An exceeding good practice here in making their fences is, they plant
the quick on the side of the bank in the common manner, and then, instead
of the dead hedge we use in England on the top of the bank, they plant a
row of old thorns, two or three feet high, which readily grow, and form at
once a most excellent fence.&nbsp; Their way also of taking in sand-banks
from the river deserves notice.&nbsp; They stake down a row of furzes at
low water, laying stones on them to the height of one or two feet; these
retain the mud, which every tide brings in, so as to fill up all within the
furze as high as their tops.&nbsp; I remarked, on the strand, that a few
boatloads of stones laid carelessly had had this <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>effect, for within
them I measured twelve inches deep of rich blue mud left behind them, the
same as they use in manuring, full of shells, and effervesced strongly with
vinegar.</p>
<p>Among the poor people the fishermen are in much the best
circumstances.&nbsp; The fishery is considerable; Waterford and its harbour
have fifty boats each, from eight to twelve tons, six men on an average to
each, but to one of six tons five men go.&nbsp; A boat of eight tons costs
&pound;40; one of twelve, &pound;60.&nbsp; To each boat there is a train of
nets of six pair, which costs from &pound;4 4s. to &pound;6 6s.; tan them
with bark.&nbsp; Their only net fishery is that of herrings, which is
commonly carried on by shares.&nbsp; The division of the fish is, first,
one-fourth for the boat; and then the men and nets divide the rest, the
latter reckoned as three men.&nbsp; They reckon ten maze of herrings an
indifferent night&rsquo;s work; when there is a good take, forty maze have
been taken, twenty a good night; the price per maze from 1s. to 7s.,
average 5s.&nbsp; Their take in 1775, the greatest they have known, when
they had more than they could dispose of, and the whole town and country
stunk of them, they retailed them thirty-two for a penny; 1773 and 1774
good years.&nbsp; They barrelled many, but in general there is an import of
Swedish.&nbsp; Besides the common articles I have registered, the following
are: pigeons, 1s. a couple; a hare, 1s.; partridges, 9d.; turbots, fine
ones, 4s. to 10s.; soles a pair, large, 1s. 6d <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>to 1s.; lobsters, 3d.
each; oysters, 6s. per hundred; rabbits, 1s. to 1s. 4d. a couple; cod, 1s.
each, large; salmon, 1&frac14;d. to 2d.</p>
<p>A very extraordinary circumstance I was told&mdash;that within five or
six years there has been much hay carried from Waterford to Norway, in the
Norway ships that bring deals.&nbsp; As hay is dear here, it proves a most
backward state of husbandry in that northerly region, since the
neighbourhood of sea-ports to which this hay can alone go is generally the
best improved in all countries.</p>
<p>October 19, the wind being fair, took my leave of Mr. Bolton, and went
back to the ship.&nbsp; Met with a fresh scene of provoking delays, so that
it was the next morning, October 20, at eight o&rsquo;clock, before we
sailed, and then it was not wind, but a cargo of passengers that spread our
sails.&nbsp; Twelve or fourteen hours are not an uncommon passage, but such
was our luck that, after being in sight of the lights on the Smalls, we
were by contrary winds blown opposite to Arklow sands.&nbsp; A violent gale
arose, which presently blew a storm that lasted thirty-six hours, in which,
under a reefed mainsail, the ship drifted up and down wearing in order to
keep clear of the coasts.</p>
<p>No wonder this appeared to me, a fresh-water sailor, as a storm, when
the oldest men on board reckoned it a violent one.&nbsp; The wind blew in
furious gusts; the waves ran very high; the cabin windows <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>burst open,
and the sea pouring in set everything afloat, and among the rest a poor
lady, who had spread her bed on the floor.&nbsp; We had, however, the
satisfaction to find, by trying the pumps every watch, that the ship made
little water.&nbsp; I had more time to attend these circumstances than the
rest of the passengers, being the only one in seven who escaped without
being sick.&nbsp; It pleased God to preserve us, but we did not cast anchor
in Milford Haven till Tuesday morning, the 22nd, at one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>It is much to be wished that there were some means of being secure of
packets sailing regularly, instead of waiting till there is such a number
of passengers as satisfies the owner and captain.&nbsp; With the
Post-Office packets there is this satisfaction, and a great one it
is.&nbsp; The contrary conduct is so perfectly detestable that I should
suppose the scheme of Waterford ones can never succeed.</p>
<p>Two years after, having been assured this conveyance was put on a new
footing, I ventured to try it again, but was mortified to find that the
<i>Tyrone</i>, the only one that could take a chaise or horses (the
<i>Countess</i> being laid up), was repairing, but would sail in five
days.&nbsp; I waited, and received assurance after assurance that she would
be ready on such a day, and then on another.&nbsp; In a word, I waited
twenty-four days before I sailed.&nbsp; Moderately speaking, I could by
Dublin have reached Turin or Milan as soon as I did <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Milford in this
conveyance.&nbsp; All this time the papers had constant advertisements of
the <i>Tyrone</i> sailing regularly, instead of letting the public know
that she was under a repair.&nbsp; Her owner seems to be a fair and worthy
man; he will therefore probably give up the scheme entirely, unless
assisted by the corporation with at least four ships more, to sail
regularly with or without passengers.&nbsp; At present it is a general
disappointment.&nbsp; I was fortunate in Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s acquaintance,
passing my time very agreeably at his hospitable mansion; but those who, in
such a case, should find a Waterford inn their resource, would curse the
<i>Tyrone</i>, and set off for Dublin.&nbsp; The expenses of this passage
are higher than those from Dublin to Holyhead: I paid&mdash;</p>

<p>1777.&nbsp; Upon a second journey to Ireland this year, I took the
opportunity of going from Dublin to Mitchelstown, by a route through the
central part of the kingdom, which I had not before sufficiently
viewed.</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Left Dublin the 24th of September, and taking the road to Naas, I
was again struck with the great population of the country, the cabins being
so much poorer in the vicinity of the capital than in the more distant
parts of the kingdom.</p>
<p>To Kildare, crossing the Curragh, so famous for its turf.&nbsp; It is a
sheep-walk of above four thousand English acres, forming a more beautiful
lawn than the hand of art ever made.&nbsp; Nothing can exceed the extreme
softness of the turf, which is of a verdure that charms the eye, and highly
set off by the gentle inequality of surface.&nbsp; The soil is a fine dry
loam on a stony bottom; it is fed by many large flocks, turned on it by the
occupiers of the adjacent farms, who alone have the right, and pay very
great rents on that account.&nbsp; It is the only considerable common in
the kingdom.&nbsp; The sheep yield very little wool, not more than 3lb. per
fleece, but of a very fine quality.</p>
<p>From Furness to Shaen Castle, in the Queen&rsquo;s County, Dean
Coote&rsquo;s; but as the husbandry, etc., of this neighbourhood is already
registered, I have only to observe that Mr. Coote was so kind as to show me
the improved grounds of Dawson&rsquo;s Court, the seat of Lord Carlow,
which I had not seen before.&nbsp; The principal beauties of the place are
the well-grown and extensive plantations, which form a shade not often met
with in Ireland.&nbsp; There is in the backgrounds a lake well accompanied
with wood, broken by several <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>islands that are covered with underwood, and
an ornamented walk passing on the banks which leads from the house.&nbsp;
This lake is in the season perfectly alive with wild-fowl.&nbsp; Near it is
a very beautiful spot, which commands a view of both woods and water; a
situation either for a house or a temple.&nbsp; Mr. Dawson is adding to the
plantations, an employment of all others the most meritorious in
Ireland.&nbsp; Another work, scarcely less so, was the erecting a large
handsome inn, wherein the same gentleman intends establishing a person who
shall be able to supply travellers post with either chaises or horses.</p>
<p>From Shaen Castle to Gloster, in the King&rsquo;s County, the seat of
John Lloyd, Esq., member for that county, to whose attention I owe the
following particulars, in which he took every means to have me well and
accurately informed.&nbsp; But first let me observe that I was much pleased
to remark, all the way from Naas quite to Rosscrea, that the country was
amongst the finest I had seen in Ireland, and consequently that I was
fortunate in having an opportunity of seeing it after the involuntary
omission of last year.&nbsp; The cabins, though many of them are very bad,
yet are better than in some other counties, and chimneys generally a part
of them.&nbsp; The people, too, have no very miserable appearance; the
breed of cattle and sheep good, and the hogs much the best I have anywhere
seen in Ireland.&nbsp; Turf is everywhere at hand, and in plenty; <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>yet are the
bogs not so general as to affect the beauty of the country, which is very
great in many tracts, with a scattering of wood, which makes it
pleasing.&nbsp; Shaen Castle stands in the midst of a very fine
tract.&nbsp; From Mountrath to Gloster, Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s, I could have
imagined myself in a very pleasing part of England.&nbsp; The country
breaks into a variety of inequalities of hill and dale; it is all well
inclosed with fine hedges; there is a plenty of wood, not so monopolised as
in many parts of the kingdom by here and there a solitary seat, but spread
over the whole face of the prospect: look which way you will, it is
cultivated and cheerful.</p>
<p>The Shannon adds not a little to the convenience and agreeableness of a
residence so near it.&nbsp; Besides affording these sorts of wild-fowl, the
quantity and size of its fish are amazing: pikes swarm in it, and rise in
weight to fifty pounds.&nbsp; In the little flat spaces on its banks are
small but deep lochs, which are covered in winter and in floods.&nbsp; When
the river withdraws, it leaves plenty of fish in them, which are caught to
put into stews.&nbsp; Mr. Holmes has a small one before his door at
Johnstown, with a little stream which feeds it.&nbsp; A trowling-rod here
gets you a bite in a moment, of a pike from twenty to forty pounds.&nbsp; I
ate of one of twenty-seven pounds so taken.&nbsp; I had also the pleasure
of seeing a fisherman bring three trout, weighing fourteen pounds, and sell
them for sixpence-halfpenny a piece.&nbsp; A couple of boats lying at
anchor, with lines <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>extended from one to the other, and hooks in
plenty from them, have been known to catch an incredible quantity of
trout.&nbsp; Colonel Prittie, in one morning, caught four stone odd pounds,
thirty-two trout.&nbsp; In general they rise from three to nine
pounds.&nbsp; Perch swarm; they appeared in the Shannon for the first time
about ten years ago, in such plenty that the poor lived on them.&nbsp;
Bream of six pounds; eels very plentiful.&nbsp; There are many gillaroos in
the river; one of twelve pounds weight was sent to Mr. Jenkinson.&nbsp;
Upon the whole, these circumstances, with the pleasure of shooting and
boating on the river, added to the glorious view it yields, and which is
enough at any time to cheer the mind, render this neighbourhood one of the
most enviable situations to live in that I have seen in Ireland.&nbsp; The
face of the country gives every circumstance of beauty.&nbsp; From
Killodeernan Hill, behind the new house building by Mr. Holmes, the whole
is seen to great advantage.&nbsp; The spreading part of the Shannon, called
Loch Derg, is commanded distinctly for many miles.&nbsp; It is in two grand
divisions of great variety: that to the north is a reach of five miles
leading to Portumna.&nbsp; The whole hither shore a scenery of hills,
checkered by enclosures and little woods, and retiring from the eye into a
rich distant prospect.&nbsp; The woods of Doras, belonging to Lord
Clanricarde, form a part of the opposite shore, and the river itself
presents an island of one hundred and twenty acres.&nbsp; Inclining <!--
page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>to the
left, a vale of rough ground, with an old castle in it, is backed by a bold
hill, which intercepts the river there, and then the great reach of fifteen
miles, the bay of Sheriff, spreads to the eye, with a magnificence not a
little added to by the boundary, a sharp outline of the county of Clare
mountains, between which and the Duharrow hills the Shannon finds its
way.&nbsp; These hills lead the eye still more to the left, till the Keeper
meets it, presenting a very beautiful outline that sinks into other ranges
of hill, uniting with the Devil&rsquo;s Bit.&nbsp; The home scenery of the
grounds, woods, hills, and lake of Johnstown, is beautiful.</p>
<p>Dancing is very general among the poor people, almost universal in every
cabin.&nbsp; Dancing-masters of their own rank travel through the country
from cabin to cabin, with a piper or blind fiddler, and the pay is sixpence
a quarter.&nbsp; It is an absolute system of education.&nbsp; Weddings are
always celebrated with much dancing, and a Sunday rarely passes without a
dance.&nbsp; There are very few among them who will not, after a hard
day&rsquo;s work, gladly walk seven miles to have a dance.&nbsp; John is
not so lively, but then a hard day&rsquo;s work with him is certainly a
different affair from what it is with Paddy.&nbsp; Other branches of
education are likewise much attended to, every child of the poorest family
learning to read, write, and cast accounts.</p>
<p>There is a very ancient custom here, for a number of country neighbours
among the poor people to fix upon <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>some young woman that
ought, as they think, to be married.&nbsp; They also agree upon a young
fellow as a proper husband for her.&nbsp; This determined, they send to the
fair one&rsquo;s cabin to inform her that on the Sunday following
&ldquo;she is to be horsed,&rdquo; that is, carried on men&rsquo;s
backs.&nbsp; She must then provide whisky and cider for a treat, as all
will pay her a visit after mass for a hurling match.&nbsp; As soon as she
is horsed, the hurling begins, in which the young fellow appointed for her
husband has the eyes of all the company fixed on him.&nbsp; If he comes off
conqueror, he is certainly married to the girl; but if another is
victorious, he as certainly loses her, for she is the prize of the
victor.&nbsp; These trials are not always finished in one Sunday; they take
sometimes two or three, and the common expression when they are over is,
that &ldquo;such a girl was goaled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes one barony hurls
against another, but a marriageable girl is always the prize.&nbsp; Hurling
is a sort of cricket, but instead of throwing the ball in order to knock
down a wicket, the aim is to pass it through a bent stick, the end stuck in
the ground.&nbsp; In these matches they perform such feats of activity as
ought to evidence the food they live on to be far from deficient in
nourishment.</p>
<p>In the hills above Derry are some very fine slate quarries, that employ
sixty men.&nbsp; The quarrymen are paid 3s. a thousand for the slates, and
the labourers 5d. a day.&nbsp; They are very fine, and sent by the Shannon
to <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>distant parts of the kingdom; the price at the quarry 6s. a
thousand, and at the shore 6s. 8d.&nbsp; Four hundred thousand slates are
raised to pay the rent only, from which some estimate may be made of the
quantity.</p>
<p>Mr. Head has a practice in his fences which deserves universal
imitation; it is planting trees for gate-posts.&nbsp; Stone piers are
expensive, and always tumbling down; trees are beautiful, and never want
repairing.&nbsp; Within fifteen years this gentleman has improved Derry so
much, that those who had only seen it before would find it almost a new
creation.&nbsp; He has built a handsome stone house, on the slope of a hill
rising from the Shannon, and backed by some fine woods, which unite with
many old hedges well planted to form a woodland scene beautiful in the
contrast to the bright expanse of the noble river below.&nbsp; The
declivity on which these woods are finishes in a mountain, which rises
above the whole.&nbsp; The Shannon gives a bend around the adjoining lands,
so as to be seen from the house both to the west and north, the lawn
falling gradually to a margin of wood on the shore, which varies the
outline.&nbsp; The river is two miles broad, and on the opposite shore
cultivated inclosures rise in some places almost to the mountain top, which
is very bold.</p>
<p>It is a very singular demesne; a stripe of very beautiful ground,
reaching two miles along the banks of the river, which forms his fence on
one side, with a wall on the other.&nbsp; There is so much wood as to
render <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>it very pleasing; adding to every day by planting all the fences
made or repaired.&nbsp; From several little hills, which rise in different
parts of it, extensive views of the river are commanded quite to Portumna;
but these are much eclipsed by that from the top of the hill above the
slate quarry.&nbsp; From thence you see the river for at least forty miles,
from Portumna to twenty miles beyond Limerick.&nbsp; It has the appearance
of a fine basin, two miles over, into which three great rivers lead, being
the north and south course and the Bay of Sheriff.&nbsp; The reaches of it
one beyond another to Portumna are fine.&nbsp; At the foot of the mountain
Mr. Head&rsquo;s demesne extends in a shore of rich woodland.</p>
<p>October 7.&nbsp; Took my leave of Mr. Head, after passing four days very
agreeably.&nbsp; Through Killaloe, over the Shannon, a very long bridge of
many arches; went out of the road to see a fall of that river at Castle
Connel, where there is such an accompaniment of wood as to form a very
pleasing scenery.&nbsp; The river takes a very rapid rocky course around a
projecting rock, on which a gentleman has built a summer-house, and formed
a terrace: it is a striking spot.&nbsp; To Limerick.&nbsp; Laid at
Bennis&rsquo;s, the first inn we had slept in from Dublin.&nbsp; God
preserve us this journey from another!</p>
<p>It is not uncommon, especially in mountainous countries, to find objects
that much deserve the attention of travellers entirely neglected by
them.&nbsp; There <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>are a few instances of this upon Lord
Kingsborough&rsquo;s estate, in the neighbourhood of Mitchelstown.&nbsp;
The first I shall mention is a cave at Skeheenrinky, on the road between
Cahir and that place.&nbsp; The opening to it is a cleft of rock in a
limestone hill, so narrow as to be difficult to get into it.&nbsp; I
descended by a ladder of about twenty steps, and then found myself in a
vault of a hundred feet long, and fifty or sixty high.&nbsp; A small hole
on the left leads from this a winding course of I believe not less than
half an Irish mile, exhibiting a variety that struck me much.&nbsp; In some
places the cavity in the rock is so large that when well lighted up by
candles (not flambeaux; Lord Kingsborough once showed it me with them, and
we found their smoke troublesome) it takes the appearance of a vaulted
cathedral, supported by massy columns.&nbsp; The walls, ceiling, floor, and
pillars, are by turns composed of every fantastic form; and often of very
beautiful incrustations of spar, some of which glitters so much that it
seems powdered with diamonds; and in others the ceiling is formed of that
sort which has so near a resemblance to a cauliflower.&nbsp; The spar
formed into columns by the dropping of water has taken some very regular
forms; but others are different, folded in plaits of light drapery, which
hang from their support in a very pleasing manner.&nbsp; The angles of the
walls seem fringed with icicles.&nbsp; One very long branch of the cave,
which turns to the north, <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>is in some places so narrow and low, that one
crawls into it, when it suddenly breaks into large vaulted spaces, in a
thousand forms.&nbsp; The spar in all this cave is very brilliant, and
almost equal to Bristol stone.&nbsp; For several hundred yards in the
larger branch there is a deep water at the bottom of the declivity to the
right, which the common people call the river.&nbsp; A part of the way is
over a sort of potter&rsquo;s clay, which moulds into any form, and is of a
brown colour; a very different soil from any in the neighbouring
country.&nbsp; I have seen the famous cave in the Peak, but think it very
much inferior to this; and Lord Kingsborough, who has viewed the Grot
d&rsquo;Aucel in Burgundy, says that it is not to be compared with it.</p>
<p>But the commanding region of the Galtees deserves more attention.&nbsp;
Those who are fond of scenes in which Nature reigns in all her wild
magnificence should visit this stupendous chain.&nbsp; It consists of many
vast mountains, thrown together in an assemblage of the most interesting
features, from the boldness and height of the declivities, freedom of
outline, and variety of parts, filling a space of about six miles by three
or four.&nbsp; Galtymore is the highest point, and rises like the lord and
father of the surrounding progeny.&nbsp; From the top you look down upon a
great extent of mountain, which shelves away from him to the south, east,
and west; but to the north the ridge is almost a perpendicular
declivity.&nbsp; On that side the <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>famous golden vale of
Limerick and Tipperary spreads a rich level to the eye, bounded by the
mountains of Clare, King&rsquo;s and Queen&rsquo;s Counties, with the
course of the Shannon, for many miles below Limerick.&nbsp; To the south
you look over alternate ridges of mountains, which rise one beyond another,
till in a clear day the eye meets the ocean near Dungarvan.&nbsp; The
mountains of Waterford and Knockmealdown fill up the space to the
south-east.&nbsp; The western is the most extensive view; for nothing stops
the eye till Mangerton and Macgillicuddy Reeks point out the spot where
Killarney&rsquo;s lake calls for a farther excursion.&nbsp; The prospect
extends into eight counties&mdash;Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick, Clare,
Queen&rsquo;s, Tipperary, King&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A little to the west of this proud summit, below it in a very
extraordinary hollow, is a circular lake of two acres, reported to be
unfathomable.&nbsp; The descriptions which I have read of the craters of
exhausted volcanoes leave very little doubt of this being one; and the
conical regularity of the summit of Galtymore speaks the same
language.&nbsp; East of this respectable hill, to use Sir William
Hamilton&rsquo;s language, is a declivity of about one-quarter of a mile,
and there Galtybeg rises in a yet more regular cone; and between the two
hills is another lake, which from its position seems to have been once the
crater which threw up Galtybeg, as the first mentioned was the origin of
Galtymore.&nbsp; Beyond <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>the former hill is a third lake, and east of
that another hill; I was told of a fourth, with another corresponding
mountain.&nbsp; It is only the mere summits of these mountains which rise
above the lakes.&nbsp; Speaking of them below, they may be said to be on
the tops of the hills.&nbsp; They are all of them at the bottom of an
almost regularly circular hollow.&nbsp; On the side next the mountain-top
are walls of perpendicular rocks, in regular strata, and some of them piled
on each other, with an appearance of art rather than nature.&nbsp; In these
rocks the eagles, which are seen in numbers on the Galtees, have their
nests.&nbsp; Supposing the mountains to be of volcanic origin, and these
lakes the craters, of which I have not a doubt, they are objects of the
greatest curiosity, for there is an unusual regularity in every
considerable summit having its corresponding crater.&nbsp; But without this
circumstance, the scenery is interesting in a very great degree.&nbsp; The
mountain summits, which are often wrapped in the clouds, at other times
exhibit the freest outline; the immense scooped hollows which sink at your
feet, declivities of so vast a depth as to give one terror to look down;
with the unusual forms of the lower region of hills, particularly Bull
Hill, and Round Hill, each a mile over, yet rising out of circular vales,
with the regularity of semi-globes, unite upon the whole to exhibit a
scenery to the eye in which the parts are of a magnitude so commanding, a
character so interesting, and a variety so striking, <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>that they well
deserve to be examined by every curious traveller.</p>
<p>Nor are these immense outlines the whole of what is to be seen in this
great range of mountains.&nbsp; Every glen has its beauties: there is a
considerable mountain river, or rather torrent, in every one of them; but
the greatest are the Funcheon, between Sefang and Galtymore; the Limestone
river, between Galtymore and Round Hill, and the Grouse river, between
Coolegarranroe and Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s mountain; these present to
the eye, for a tract of about three miles, every variety that rock, water,
and mountain can give, thrown into all the fantastic forms which art may
attempt in ornamented grounds, but always fails in.&nbsp; Nothing can
exceed the beauty of the water, when not discoloured by rain; its lucid
transparency shows, at considerable depths, every pebble no bigger than a
pin, every rocky basin alive with trout and eels, that play and dash among
the rocks as if endowed with that native vigour which animates, in a
superior degree, every inhabitant of the mountains, from the bounding red
deer and the soaring eagle down even to the fishes of the brook.&nbsp;
Every five minutes you have a water-fall in these glens, which in any other
region would stop every traveller to admire it.&nbsp; Sometimes the vale
takes a gentle declivity, and presents to the eye at one stroke twenty or
thirty falls, which render the scenery all alive with motion; the rocks are
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>tossed about in the wildest confusion, and the torrent bursts by
turns from above, beneath, and under them; while the background is always
filled up with the mountains which stretch around.</p>
<p>In the western glen is the finest cascade in all the Galtees.&nbsp;
There are two falls, with a basin in the rock between, but from some points
of view they appear one: the rock over which the water tumbles is about
sixty feet high.&nbsp; A good line in which to view these objects is either
to take the Killarney and Mallow road to Mitchelstown and from thence by
Lord Kingsborough&rsquo;s new one to Skeheenrinky, there to take one of the
glens to Galtybeg and Galtymore, and return to Mitchelstown by the
Wolf&rsquo;s Track, Temple Hill, and the Waterfall; or, if the Cork road is
travelling, to make Dobbin&rsquo;s inn, at Ballyporeen, the head-quarters,
and view them from thence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Having heard much of the beauties of a part of the Queen&rsquo;s County
I had not before seen, I took that line of country in my way on a journey
to Dublin.</p>
<p>From Mitchelstown to Cashel, the road leads as far as Galbally in the
route already travelled from Cullen.&nbsp; Towards Cashel the country is
various.&nbsp; The only objects deserving attention are the plantations of
Thomastown, the seat of Francis Mathew, Esq.; they consist chiefly of
hedgerow trees in double and treble rows, are well grown, and of such
extent as to form an <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>uncommon woodland scene in Ireland.&nbsp;
Found the widow Holland&rsquo;s inn, at Cashel, clean and very civil.&nbsp;
Take the road to Urlingford.&nbsp; The rich sheep pastures, part of the
famous golden vale, reach between three and four miles from Cashel to the
great bog by Botany Hill, noted for producing a greater variety of plants
than common.&nbsp; That bog is separated by only small tracts of land from
the string of bogs which extend through the Queen&rsquo;s County, from the
great bog of Allen; it is here of considerable extent, and exceedingly
improvable.&nbsp; Then enter a low marshy bad country, which grows worse
after passing the sixty-sixth milestone, and successive bogs in it.&nbsp;
Breakfast at Johnstown, a regular village on a slight eminence, built by
Mr. Hayley.&nbsp; It is near the spa of Ballyspellin.</p>
<p>Rows of trees are planted, but their heads all cut off, I suppose from
their not thriving, being planted too old.&nbsp; Immediately on leaving
these planted avenues, enter a row of eight or ten new cabins, at a
distance from each other, which appear to be a new undertaking, the land
about them all pared and burnt, and the ashes in heaps.</p>
<p>Enter a fine planted country, with much corn and good thriving quick
hedges for many miles.&nbsp; The road leads through a large wood, which
joins Lord Ashbrook&rsquo;s plantations, whose house is situated in the
midst of more wood than almost any one I have seen in Ireland.&nbsp; Pass
Durrow; the country for two or three <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>miles continues all
inclosed with fine quick hedges, is beautiful, and has some resemblance to
the best parts of Essex.&nbsp; Sir Robert Staple&rsquo;s improvements join
this fine tract.&nbsp; They are completed in a most perfect manner, the
hedges well grown, cut, and in such excellent order that I can scarcely
believe myself to be in Ireland.&nbsp; His gates are all of iron.&nbsp;
These sylvan scenes continue through other seats, beautifully situated
amidst gentle declivities of the finest verdure, full-grown woods,
excellent hedges, and a pretty river winding by the house.&nbsp; The whole
environs of several would be admired in the best parts of England.</p>
<p>Cross a great bog, within sight of Lord de Vesci&rsquo;s
plantations.&nbsp; The road leads over it, being drained for that purpose
by deep cuts on either side.&nbsp; I should apprehend this bog to be among
the most improvable in the country.&nbsp; Slept at Ballyroan, at an inn
kept by three animals who call themselves women; met with more impertinence
than at any other in Ireland.&nbsp; It is an execrable hole.&nbsp; In three
or four miles pass Sir John Parnel&rsquo;s, prettily situated in a neatly
dressed lawn, with much wood about it, and a lake quite alive with wild
fowl.</p>
<p>Pass Monstereven, and cross directly a large bog, drained and partly
improved; but all of it bearing grass, and seems in a state that might
easily be reduced to rich meadow, with only a dressing of lime.&nbsp; Here
I got again into the road I had travelled before.</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>I must in general remark, that from near Urlingford to Dawson
Court, near Monstereven, which is completely across the Queen&rsquo;s
County, is a line of above thirty English miles, and is for that extent by
much the most improved of any I have seen in Ireland.&nbsp; It is generally
well planted, has many woods, and not consisting of patches of plantation
just by gentlemen&rsquo;s houses, but spreading over the whole face of the
country, so as to give it the richness of an English woodland scene.&nbsp;
What a country would Ireland be had the inhabitants of the rest of it
improved the whole like this!</p>
<h2>PART II.</h2>
<h3>SECTION I.&mdash;Soil, Face of the Country, and Climate.</h3>
<p>To judge of Ireland by the conversation one sometimes hears in England,
it would be supposed that one-half of it was covered with bogs, and the
other with mountains filled with Irish ready to fly at the sight of a
civilised being.&nbsp; There are people who will smile when they hear that,
in proportion to the size of the two countries, Ireland is more cultivated
than England, having much less waste land of all sorts.&nbsp; Of
uncultivated mountains there are no such tracts as are found in our four
northern counties, and the North <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Riding of Yorkshire,
with the eastern line of Lancaster, nearly down to the Peak of Derby, which
form an extent of above a hundred miles of waste.&nbsp; The most
considerable of this sort in Ireland are in Kerry, Galway, and Mayo, and
some in Sligo and Donegal.&nbsp; But all these together will not make the
quantity we have in the four northern counties; the valleys in the Irish
mountains are also more inhabited, I think, than those of England, except
where there are mines, and consequently some sort of cultivation creeping
up the sides.&nbsp; Natural fertility, acre for acre over the two kingdoms,
is certainly in favour of Ireland; of this I believe there can scarcely be
a doubt entertained, when it is considered that some of the more beautiful,
and even best cultivated counties in England, owe almost everything to the
capital, art, and industry of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The circumstance which strikes me as the greatest singularity of Ireland
is the rockiness of the soil, which should seem at first sight against that
degree of fertility; but the contrary is the fact.&nbsp; Stone is so
general, that I have great reason to believe the whole island is one vast
rock of different strata and kinds rising out of the sea.&nbsp; I have
rarely heard of any great depths being sunk without meeting with it.&nbsp;
In general it appears on the surface in every part of the kingdom; the
flattest and most fertile parts, as Limerick, Tipperary, and Meath, have it
at no great <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>depth, almost as much as the more barren ones.&nbsp; May we not
recognise in this the hand of bounteous Providence, which has given perhaps
the most stony soil in Europe to the moistest climate in it?&nbsp; If as
much rain fell upon the clays of England (a soil very rarely met with in
Ireland, and never without much stone) as falls upon the rocks of her
sister island, those lands could not be cultivated.&nbsp; But the rocks are
here clothed with verdure; those of limestone, with only a thin covering of
mould, have the softest and most beautiful turf imaginable.</p>
<p>Of the great advantages resulting from the general plenty of limestone
and limestone gravel, and the nature of the bogs, I shall have occasion to
speak more particularly hereafter.</p>
<p>The rockiness of the soil in Ireland is so universal that it
predominates in every sort.&nbsp; One cannot use with propriety the terms
clay, loam, sand, etc.; it must be a stony clay, a stony loam, a gravelly
sand.&nbsp; Clay, especially the yellow, is much talked of in Ireland, but
it is for want of proper discrimination.&nbsp; I have once or twice seen
almost a pure clay upon the surface, but it is extremely rare.&nbsp; The
true yellow clay is usually found in a thin stratum under the surface
mould, and over a rock; harsh, tenacious, stony, strong loams, difficult to
work, are not uncommon: but they are quite different from English
clays.</p>
<p>Friable, sandy loams, dry but fertile, are very <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>common, and they form
the best soils in the kingdom for tillage and sheep.&nbsp; Tipperary and
Roscommon abound particularly in them.&nbsp; The most fertile of all are
the bullock pastures of Limerick, and the banks of the Shannon in Clare,
called the Corcasses.&nbsp; These are a mellow, putrid, friable loam.</p>
<p>Sand which is so common in England, and yet more common through Spain,
France, Germany, and Poland, quite from Gibraltar to Petersburg, is nowhere
met with in Ireland, except for narrow slips of hillocks, upon the sea
coast.&nbsp; Nor did I ever meet with or hear of a chalky soil.</p>
<p>The bogs, of which foreigners have heard so much, are very extensive in
Ireland; that of Allen extends eighty miles, and is computed to contain
three hundred thousand acres.&nbsp; There are others also, very extensive,
and smaller ones scattered over the whole kingdom; but these are not in
general more than are wanted for fuel.&nbsp; When I come to speak of the
improvement of waste lands, I shall describe them particularly.</p>
<p>Besides the great fertility of the soil, there are other circumstances
which come within my sphere to mention.&nbsp; Few countries can be better
watered by large and beautiful rivers; and it is remarkable that by much
the finest parts of the kingdom are on the banks of these rivers.&nbsp;
Witness the Suir, Blackwater, the Liffey, the Boyne, the Nore, the Barrow,
and part of the Shannon, they wash a scenery that can hardly be <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>exceeded.&nbsp; From the rockiness of the country, however, there
are few of them that have not obstructions, which are great impediments to
inland navigation.</p>
<p>The mountains of Ireland give to travelling that interesting variety
which a flat country can never abound with.&nbsp; And, at the same time,
they are not in such number as to confer the usual character of poverty
which attends them.&nbsp; I was either upon or very near the most
considerable in the kingdom.&nbsp; Mangerton, and the Reeks, in Kerry; the
Galties in Cork; those of Mourne in Down; Crow Patrick, and Nephin in Mayo,
these are the principal in Ireland, and they are of a character, in height
and sublimity, which should render them the objects of every
traveller&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Relative to the climate of Ireland, a short residence cannot enable a
man to speak much from his own experience; the observations I have made
myself confirm the idea of its being vastly wetter than England; from the
20th of June to the 20th of October I kept a register, and there were, in
one hundred and twenty-two days, seventy-five of rain, and very many of
them incessant and heavy.&nbsp; I have examined similar registers I kept in
England, and can find no year that even approaches to such a moisture as
this.&nbsp; But there is a register of an accurate diary published which
compares London and Cork.&nbsp; The result is, that the quantity at the
latter place was double to that at London.&nbsp; See Smith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of Cork.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>From the information I received, I have reason to believe that
the rainy season sets in usually about the first of July and continues very
wet till September or October, when there is usually a dry fine season of a
month or six weeks.&nbsp; I resided in the county of Cork, etc., from
October till March, and found the winter much more soft and mild than ever
I experienced one in England.&nbsp; I was also a whole summer there (1778),
and it is fair to mention that it was as fine a one as ever I knew in
England, though by no means so hot.&nbsp; I think hardly so wet as very
many I have known in England.&nbsp; The tops of the Galty mountains
exhibited the only snow we saw; and as to frosts, they were so slight and
rare that I believe myrtles, and yet tenderer plants, would have survived
without any covering.&nbsp; But when I say that the winter was not
remarkable for being wet, I do not mean that we had a dry atmosphere.&nbsp;
The inches of rain which fell in the winter I speak of would not mark the
moisture of the climate.&nbsp; As many inches will fall in a single
tropical shower as in a whole year in England.&nbsp; See Mitchel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Present State of Great Britain and North America.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
if the clouds presently disperse, and a bright sun shines, the air may soon
be dry.&nbsp; The worst circumstance of the climate of Ireland is the
constant moisture without rain.&nbsp; Wet a piece of leather, and lay it in
a room where there is neither sun nor fire, and it will not in summer even
be dry in a month.&nbsp; I have known <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>gentlemen in Ireland
deny their climate being moister than England, but if they have eyes let
them open them, and see the verdure that clothes their rocks, and compare
it with ours in England&mdash;where rocky soils are of a russet brown
however sweet the food for sheep.&nbsp; Does not their island lie more
exposed to the great Atlantic; and does not the west wind blow
three-fourths of a year?&nbsp; If there was another island yet more
westward, would not the climate of Ireland be improved?&nbsp; Such persons
speak equally against fact, reason, and philosophy.&nbsp; That the moisture
of a climate does not depend on the quantity of rain that falls, but on the
powers of aerial evaporation, Dr. Dobson has clearly proved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Phil. Trans.&rdquo; vol. lxvii., part i., p. 244.</p>
<h4>Oppression.</h4>
<p>Before I conclude this article of the common labouring poor in Ireland,
I must observe, that their happiness depends not merely upon the payment of
their labour, their clothes, or their food; the subordination of the lower
classes, degenerating into oppression, is not to be overlooked.&nbsp; The
poor in all countries, and under all governments, are both paid and fed,
yet there is an infinite difference between them in different ones.&nbsp;
This inquiry will by no means turn out so favourable as the preceding
articles.&nbsp; It must be very apparent to every traveller through that
country, that <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the labouring poor are treated with harshness,
and are in all respects so little considered that their want of importance
seems a perfect contrast to their situation in England, of which country,
comparatively speaking, they reign the sovereigns.&nbsp; The age has
improved so much in humanity, that even the poor Irish have experienced its
influence, and are every day treated better and better; but still the
remnant of the old manners, the abominable distinction of religion, united
with the oppressive conduct of the little country gentlemen, or rather
vermin of the kingdom, who never were out of it, altogether bear still very
heavy on the poor people, and subject them to situations more mortifying
than we ever behold in England.&nbsp; The landlord of an Irish estate,
inhabited by Roman Catholics, is a sort of despot who yields obedience, in
whatever concerns the poor, to no law but that of his will.&nbsp; To
discover what the liberty of the people is, we must live among them, and
not look for it in the statutes of the realm: the language of written law
may be that of liberty, but the situation of the poor may speak no language
but that of slavery.&nbsp; There is too much of this contradiction in
Ireland; a long series of oppressions, aided by many very ill-judged laws,
have brought landlords into a habit of exerting a very lofty superiority,
and their vassals into that of an almost unlimited submission: speaking a
language that is despised, professing a religion that is abhorred <!-- page
166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>and being
disarmed, the poor find themselves in many cases slaves even in the bosom
of written liberty.&nbsp; Landlords that have resided much abroad are
usually humane in their ideas, but the habit of tyranny naturally contracts
the mind, so that even in this polished age there are instances of a severe
carriage towards the poor, which is quite unknown in England.</p>
<p>A landlord in Ireland can scarcely invent an order which a servant,
labourer, or cottar dares to refuse to execute.&nbsp; Nothing satisfies him
but an unlimited submission.&nbsp; Disrespect, or anything tending towards
sauciness, he may punish with his cane or his horsewhip with the most
perfect security; a poor man would have his bones broke if he offered to
lift his hands in his own defence.&nbsp; Knocking-down is spoken of in the
country in a manner that makes an Englishman stare.&nbsp; Landlords of
consequence have assured me that many of their cottars would think
themselves honoured by having their wives and daughters sent for to the bed
of their master; a mark of slavery that proves the oppression under which
such people must live.&nbsp; Nay, I have heard anecdotes of the lives of
people being made free with without any apprehension of the justice of a
jury.&nbsp; But let it not be imagined that this is common; formerly it
happened every day, but law gains ground.&nbsp; It must strike the most
careless traveller to see whole strings of cars whipped into a ditch by a
gentleman&rsquo;s footman to make way for his <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>carriage; if they are
overturned or broken in pieces, no matter, it is taken in patience; were
they to complain they would perhaps be horsewhipped.&nbsp; The execution of
the laws lies very much in the hands of justices of the peace, many of whom
are drawn from the most illiberal class in the kingdom.&nbsp; If a poor man
lodges a complaint against a gentleman, or any animal that chooses to call
itself a gentleman, and the justice issues out a summons for his
appearance, it is a fixed affront, and he will infallibly be called
out.&nbsp; Where manners are in conspiracy against law, to whom are the
oppressed people to have recourse?&nbsp; It is a fact, that a poor man
having a contest with a gentleman, must&mdash;but I am talking nonsense,
they know their situation too well to think of it; they can have no
defence, but by means of protection from one gentleman against another, who
probably protects his vassal as he would the sheep he intends to eat.</p>
<p>The colours of this picture are not charged.&nbsp; To assert that all
these cases are common would be an exaggeration, but to say that an
unfeeling landlord will do all this with impunity, is to keep strictly to
truth: and what is liberty but a farce and a jest, if its blessings are
received as the favour of kindness and humanity, instead of being the
inheritance of right?</p>
<p>Consequences have flowed from these oppressions which ought long ago to
have put a stop to them.&nbsp; In <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>England we have heard
much of White-boys, Steel-boys, Oak-boys, Peep-of-day-boys, etc.&nbsp; But
these various insurgents are not to be confounded, for they are very
different.&nbsp; The proper distinction in the discontents of the people is
into Protestant and Catholic.&nbsp; All but the White-boys were among the
manufacturing Protestants in the north: the White-boys Catholic labourers
in the south.&nbsp; From the best intelligence I could gain, the riots of
the manufacturers had no other foundation but such variations in the
manufacture as all fabrics experience, and which they had themselves known
and submitted to before.&nbsp; The case, however, was different with the
White-boys, who being labouring Catholics met with all those oppressions I
have described, and would probably have continued in full submission had
not very severe treatment in respect of tithes, united with a great
speculative rise of rent about the same time, blown up the flame of
resistance; the atrocious acts they were guilty of made them the object of
general indignation; acts were passed for their punishment, which seemed
calculated for the meridian of Barbary.&nbsp; This arose to such a height
that by one they were to be hanged under circumstances without the common
formalities of a trial, which, though repealed the following session, marks
the spirit of punishment; while others remain yet the law of the land, that
would if executed tend more to raise than quell an insurrection.&nbsp; From
all <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>which it is manifest that the gentlemen of Ireland never thought
of a radical cure from overlooking the real cause of the disease, which in
fact lay in themselves, and not in the wretches they doomed to the
gallows.&nbsp; Let them change their own conduct entirely, and the poor
will not long riot.&nbsp; Treat them like men who ought to be as free as
yourselves.&nbsp; Put an end to that system of religious persecution which
for seventy years has divided the kingdom against itself; in these two
circumstances lies the cure of insurrection; perform them completely, and
you will have an affectionate poor, instead of oppressed and discontented
vassals.</p>
<p>A better treatment of the poor in Ireland is a very material point of
the welfare of the whole British Empire.&nbsp; Events may happen which may
convince us fatally of this truth; if not, oppression must have broken all
the spirit and resentment of men.&nbsp; By what policy the Government of
England can for so many years have permitted such an absurd system to be
matured in Ireland is beyond the power of plain sense to discover.</p>
<h4>Emigrations.</h4>
<p>Before the American war broke out, the Irish and Scotch emigrations were
a constant subject of conversation in England, and occasioned much
discourse even in parliament.&nbsp; The common observation was, <!-- page
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>that if they
were not stopped, those countries would be ruined, and they were generally
attributed to a great rise of rents.&nbsp; Upon going over to Ireland I
determined to omit no opportunities of discovering the cause and extent of
this emigration, and my information, as may be seen in the minutes of the
journey, was very regular.&nbsp; I have only a few general remarks to make
on it here.</p>
<p>The spirit of emigration in Ireland appeared to be confined to two
circumstances, the Presbyterian religion, and the linen manufacture.&nbsp;
I heard of very few emigrants except among manufacturers of that
persuasion.&nbsp; The Catholics never went; they seem not only tied to the
country, but almost to the parish in which their ancestors lived.&nbsp; As
to the emigration in the north it was an error in England to suppose it a
novelty which arose with the increase in rents.&nbsp; The contrary was the
fact; it had subsisted perhaps forty years, insomuch that at the ports of
Belfast, Derry, etc., the passenger trade, as they called it, had long been
a regular branch of commerce, which employed several ships, and consisted
in carrying people to America.&nbsp; The increasing population of the
country made it an increasing trade, but when the linen trade was low, the
passenger trade was always high.&nbsp; At the time of Lord Donegan letting
his estate in the north, the linen business suffered a temporary decline,
which sent great numbers to America, and gave rise to <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the error that it was
occasioned by the increase of his rents.&nbsp; The fact, however, was
otherwise, for great numbers of those who went from his lands actually sold
those leases for considerable sums, the hardship of which was supposed to
have driven them to America.&nbsp; Some emigration, therefore, always
existed, and its increase depended on the fluctuations of linen; but as to
the effect there was as much error in the conclusions drawn in England as
before in the cause.</p>
<p>It is the misfortune of all manufactures worked for a foreign market to
be upon an insecure footing; periods of declension will come, and when in
consequence of them great numbers of people are out of employment, the best
circumstance is their enlisting in the army or navy, and it is the common
result; but unfortunately the manufacture in Ireland (of which I shall have
occasion to speak more hereafter) is not confined as it ought to be to
towns, but spreads into all cabins of the country.&nbsp; Being half
farmers, half manufacturers, they have too much property in cattle, etc.,
to enlist when idle; if they convert it into cash it will enable them to
pay their passage to America, an alternative always chosen in preference to
the military life.&nbsp; The consequence is, that they must live without
work till their substance is quite consumed before they will enlist.&nbsp;
Men who are in such a situation that from various causes they cannot work,
and won&rsquo;t enlist, should emigrate; if they stay at home they must
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>remain a burthen upon the community.&nbsp; Emigration should not,
therefore, be condemned in states so ill-governed as to possess many people
willing to work, but without employment.</p>
<h3>SECTION II.&mdash;Roads, Cars.</h3>
<p>For a country, so very far behind us as Ireland, to have got suddenly so
much the start of us in the article of roads, is a spectacle that cannot
fail to strike the English traveller exceedingly.&nbsp; But from this
commendation the turnpikes in general must be excluded; they are as bad as
the bye-roads are admirable.&nbsp; It is a common complaint that the tolls
of the turnpikes are so many jobs, and the roads left in a state that
disgrace the kingdom.</p>
<p>The following is the system on which the cross-roads are made.&nbsp; Any
person wishing to make or mend a road has it measured by two persons, who
swear to the measurement before a justice of the peace.&nbsp; It is
described as leading from one market-town to another (it matters not in
what direction), that it will be a public good, and that it will require
such a sum per perch of twenty-one feet, to make or repair the same.&nbsp;
A certificate to this purpose (of which printed forms are sold), with the
blanks filled up, is signed by the measurers, and also by two persons
called overseers, one of whom is usually the person applying for the road,
the <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>other the labourer he intends to employ as an overseer of the
work, which overseer swears also before the justice the truth of the
valuation.&nbsp; The certificate thus prepared is given by any person to
some one of the grand jury, at either of the assizes, but usually in the
spring.&nbsp; When all the common business of trials is over, the jury
meets on that of roads; the chairman reads the certificates, and they are
all put to the vote, whether to be granted or not.&nbsp; If rejected, they
are torn in pieces and no further notice taken; if granted, they are put on
the file.</p>
<p>This vote of approbation, without any further form, enables the person
who applied for the presentment immediately to construct or repair the road
in question, which he must do at his own expense; he must finish it by the
following assizes, when he is to send a certificate of his having expended
the money pursuant to the application; this certificate is signed by the
foreman, who also signs an order on the treasurer of the county to pay him,
which is done immediately.&nbsp; In like manner are bridges, houses of
correction, gaols, etc. etc., built and repaired.&nbsp; If a bridge over a
river which parts two counties, half is done by one and the other half by
the other county.</p>
<p>The expense of these works is raised by a tax on the lands, paid by the
tenant; in some counties it is acreable, but in others it is on the plough
land, and as no two plough lands are of the same size, is a very unequal
<!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>tax.&nbsp; In the county of Meath it is acreable, and amounts to
one shilling per acre, being the highest in Ireland; but in general it is
from threepence to sixpence per acre, and amounts of late years through the
whole kingdom to one hundred and forty thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>The juries will very rarely grant a presentment for a road which amounts
to above fifty pounds, or for more than six or seven shillings a perch, so
that if a person wants more to be made than such a sum will do, he divides
it into two or three different measurements or presentments.&nbsp; By the
Act of Parliament, all presentment-roads must be twenty-one feet wide at
least from fence to fence, and fourteen feet of it formed with stone or
gravel.</p>
<p>As the power of the grand jury extends in this manner to the cutting new
roads where none ever were before, as well as to the repairing and widening
old ones, exclusive, however, of parks, gardens, etc., it was necessary to
put a restriction against the wanton expense of it.&nbsp; Any presentment
may be traversed that is opposed, by denying the allegations of the
certificate; this is sure of delaying it until another assizes, and in the
meantime persons are appointed to view the line of road demanded, and
report on the necessity or hardship of the case.&nbsp; The payment of the
money may also be traversed after the certificate of its being laid out;
for if any person views and finds it a manifest imposition <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>and job, he
has that power to delay payment until the cause is cleared up and
proved.&nbsp; But this traverse is not common.&nbsp; Any persons are
eligible for asking presentments; but it is usually done only by resident
gentlemen, agents, clergy, or respectable tenantry.&nbsp; It follows
necessarily, that every person is desirous of making the roads leading to
his own house, and that private interest alone is considered in it, which I
have heard objected to the measure; but this I must own appears to me the
great merit of it.&nbsp; Whenever individuals act for the public alone, the
public is very badly served; but when the pursuit of their own interest is
the way to benefit the public, then is the public good sure to be promoted;
such is the case of presentment of roads: for a few years the good roads
were all found leading from houses like rays from a centre, with a
surrounding space, without any communication; but every year brought the
remedy, until in a short time, those rays pointing from so many centres
met, and then the communication was complete.&nbsp; The original Act passed
but seventeen years ago, and the effect of it in all parts of the kingdom
is so great, that I found it perfectly practicable to travel upon wheels by
a map; I will go here; I will go there; I could trace a route upon paper as
wild as fancy could dictate, and everywhere I found beautiful roads without
break or hindrance, to enable me to realise my design.&nbsp; What a figure
would a person make in <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>England, who should attempt to move in that
manner, where the roads, as Dr. Burn has well observed, are almost in as
bad a state as in the time of Philip and Mary.&nbsp; In a few years there
will not be a piece of bad road except turnpikes in all Ireland.&nbsp; The
money raised for this first and most important of all national purposes, is
expended among the people who pay it, employs themselves and their teams,
encourages their agriculture, and facilitates so greatly the improvement of
waste lands, that it ought always to be considered as the first step to any
undertaking of that sort.</p>
<p>At first, roads, in common with bridges, were paid out of the general
treasure of the county, but by a subsequent act the road tax is now on
baronies; each barony pays for its own roads.&nbsp; By another act juries
were enabled to grant presentments of narrow mountain roads, at two
shillings and sixpence a perch.&nbsp; By another, they were empowered to
grant presentments of footpaths, by the side of roads, at one shilling a
perch.&nbsp; By a very late act, they are also enabled to contract at
three-halfpence per perch per annum from the first making of a road, for
keeping it in repair, which before could not be done without a fresh
presentment.&nbsp; Arthur King, Esq. of Moniva, whose agriculture is
described in the preceding minutes, and who at that time represented the
county of Galway, was the worthy citizen who first brought this excellent
measure into parliament: Ireland, and every <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>traveller that ever
visits it ought, to the latest time, to revere the memory of such a
distinguished benefactor to the public.&nbsp; Before that time the roads,
like those of England, remained impassable, under the miserable police of
the six days&rsquo; labour.&nbsp; Similar good effects would here flow from
adopting the measure, which would ease the kingdom of a great burthen in
its public effects absolutely contemptible; and the tax here, as in
Ireland, ought to be so laid, as to be borne by the tenant whose business
it is at present to repair.</p>
<p>Upon the imperfections of the Irish system I have only to remark, that
juries should, in some cases, be more ready than they are to grant these
presentments.&nbsp; In general, they are extremely liberal, but sometimes
they take silly freaks of giving none, or very few.&nbsp; Experience having
proved, from the general goodness of the roads, that abuses cannot be very
great, they should go on with spirit to perfect the great work throughout
the kingdom; and as a check upon those who lay out the money, it might
perhaps be advisable to print county maps of the presentment roads, with
corresponding lists and tables of the names of all persons who have
obtained presentments, the sums they received, and for what roads.&nbsp;
These should be given freely by the jurymen, to all their acquaintance,
that every man might know, to whose carelessness or jobbing the public was
indebted for bad roads, when <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>they had paid for good ones.&nbsp; Such a
practice would certainly deter many.</p>
<p>At 11,042,642 acres in the kingdom, &pound;140,000 a year amounts to
just threepence an acre for the whole territory: a very trifling tax for
such an improvement, and which almost ranks in public ease and benefit with
that of the post-office.</p>
<h3>SECTION III.&mdash;Manners and Customs.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Quid leges sine moribus,<br />
Vana proficiunt!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is but an illiberal business for a traveller, who designs to publish
remarks upon a country to sit down coolly in his closet and write a satire
on the inhabitants.&nbsp; Severity of that sort must be enlivened with an
uncommon share of wit and ridicule, to please.&nbsp; Where very gross
absurdities are found, it is fair and manly to note them; but to enter into
character and disposition is generally uncandid, since there are no people
but might be better than they are found, and none but have virtues which
deserve attention, at least as much as their failings; for these reasons
this section would not have found a place in my observations, had not some
persons, of much more flippancy than wisdom, given very gross
misrepresentations of the Irish nation.&nbsp; It is with pleasure,
therefore, that I take up the pen on the present occasion; as a much longer
residence there <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>enables me to exhibit a very different
picture; in doing this, I shall be free to remark, wherein I think the
conduct of certain classes may have given rise to general and consequently
injurious condemnation.</p>
<p>There are three races of people in Ireland, so distinct as to strike the
least attentive traveller: these are the Spanish which are found in Kerry,
and a part of Limerick and Cork, tall and thin, but well made, a long
visage, dark eyes, and long black lank hair.&nbsp; The time is not remote
when the Spaniards had a kind of settlement on the coast of Kerry, which
seemed to be overlooked by government.&nbsp; There were many of them in
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, nor were they entirely driven out till the
time of Cromwell.&nbsp; There is an island of Valentia on that coast, with
various other names, certainly Spanish.&nbsp; The Scotch race is in the
north, where are to be found the feature which are supposed to mark that
people, their accent and many of their customs.&nbsp; In a district near
Dublin, but more particularly in the baronies of Bargie and Forth in the
county of Wexford, the Saxon tongue is spoken without any mixture of the
Irish, and the people have a variety of customs mentioned in the minutes,
which distinguish them from their neighbours.&nbsp; The rest of the kingdom
is made up of mongrels.&nbsp; The Milesian race of Irish, which may be
called native, are scattered over the kingdom, but chiefly found in
Connaught and Munster; a few considerable families, whose genealogy <!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>is
undoubted, remain, but none of them with considerable possessions except
the O&rsquo;Briens and Mr. O&rsquo;Neil; the former have near twenty
thousand pounds a year in the family, the latter half as much, the remnant
of a property once his ancestors, which now forms six or seven of the
greatest estates in the kingdom.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Hara and M&rsquo;Dermot are
great names in Connaught, and O&rsquo;Donnohue a considerable one in Kerry;
but I heard of a family of O&rsquo;Drischal&rsquo;s in Cork, who claim an
origin prior in Ireland to any of the Milesian race.</p>
<p>The only divisions which a traveller, who passed through the kingdom
without making any residence could make, would be into people of
considerable fortune and mob.&nbsp; The intermediate division of the scale,
so numerous and respectable in England, would hardly attract the least
notice in Ireland.&nbsp; A residence in the kingdom convinces one, however,
that there is another class in general of small fortune&mdash;country
gentlemen and renters of land.&nbsp; The manners, habits, and customs of
people of considerable fortune are much the same everywhere, at least there
is very little difference between England and Ireland, it is among the
common people one must look for those traits by which we discriminate a
national character.&nbsp; The circumstances which struck me most in the
common Irish were, vivacity and a great and eloquent volubility of speech;
one would think they could take snuff and talk without tiring till
doomsday.&nbsp; They are infinitely more cheerful and <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>lively than anything
we commonly see in England, having nothing of that incivility of sullen
silence with which so many Englishmen seem to wrap themselves up, as if
retiring within their own importance.&nbsp; Lazy to an excess at work, but
so spiritedly active at play, that at hurling, which is the cricket of
savages, they shew the greatest feats of agility.&nbsp; Their love of
society is as remarkable as their curiosity is insatiable; and their
hospitality to all comers, be their own poverty ever so pinching, has too
much merit to be forgotten.&nbsp; Pleased to enjoyment with a joke, or
witty repartee, they will repeat it with such expression, that the laugh
will be universal.&nbsp; Warm friends and revengeful enemies; they are
inviolable in their secrecy, and inevitable in their resentment; with such
a notion of honour, that neither threat nor reward would induce them to
betray the secret or person of a man, though an oppressor, whose property
they would plunder without ceremony.&nbsp; Hard drinkers and quarrelsome;
great liars, but civil, submissive, and obedient.&nbsp; Dancing is so
universal among them, that there are everywhere itinerant dancing-masters,
to whom the cottars pay sixpence a quarter for teaching their
families.&nbsp; Besides the Irish jig, which they can dance with a most
luxuriant expression, minuets and country-dances are taught; and I even
heard some talk of cotillions coming in.</p>
<p>Some degree of education is also general, hedge <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>schools, as they are
called, (they might as well be termed ditch ones, for I have seen many a
ditch full of scholars,) are everywhere to be met with where reading and
writing are taught; schools are also common for men; I have seen a dozen
great fellows at school, and was told they were educating with an intention
of being priests.&nbsp; Many strokes in their character are evidently to be
ascribed to the extreme oppression under which they live.&nbsp; If they are
as great thieves and liars as they are reported, it is certainly owing to
this cause.</p>
<p>If from the lowest class we rise to the highest, all there is gaiety,
pleasure, luxury, and extravagance; the town life at Dublin is formed on
the model of that of London.&nbsp; Every night in the winter there is a
ball or a party, where the polite circle meet, not to enjoy but to sweat
each other; a great crowd crammed into twenty feet square gives a zest to
the <i>agr&eacute;ments</i> of small talk and whist.&nbsp; There are four
or five houses large enough to receive a company commodiously, but the rest
are so small as to make parties detestable.&nbsp; There is however an
agreeable society in Dublin, in which a man of large fortune will not find
his time heavy.&nbsp; The style of living may be guessed from the fortunes
of the resident nobility and great commoners; there are about thirty that
possess incomes from seven to twenty thousand pounds a year.&nbsp; The
court has nothing remarkable or splendid in it, but varies very <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>much,
according to the private fortune or liberality of disposition in the lord
lieutenant.</p>
<p>In the country their life has some circumstances which are not commonly
seen in England.&nbsp; Large tracts of land are kept in hand by everybody
to supply the deficiencies of markets; this gives such a plenty, that,
united with the lowness of taxes and prices, one would suppose it difficult
for them to spend their incomes, if Dublin in the winter did not lend
assistance.&nbsp; Let it be considered that the prices of meat are much
lower than in England; poultry only a fourth of the price; wild fowl and
fish in vastly greater plenty; rum and brandy not half the price; coffee,
tea, and wines far cheaper; labour not above a third; servants&rsquo; wages
upon an average thirty per cent. cheaper.&nbsp; That taxes are
inconsiderable, for there is no land-tax, no poor-rates, no window tax, no
candle or soap tax, only half a wheel-tax, no servants&rsquo; tax, and a
variety of other articles heavily burdened in England, but not in
Ireland.&nbsp; Considering all this, one would think they could not spend
their incomes; they do contrive it, however.&nbsp; In this business they
are assisted by two customs that have an admirable tendency to it, great
numbers of horses and servants.</p>
<p>In England such extensive demesnes would be parks around the seats for
beauty as much as use, but it is not so in Ireland; the words deer-park and
demesne <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>are to be distinguished; there are great demesnes without any
parks, but a want of taste, too common in Ireland, is having a deer-park at
a distance from the house; the residence surrounded by walls, or hedges, or
cabins; and the lawn inclosure scattered with animals of various sorts,
perhaps three miles off.&nbsp; The small quantity of corn proportioned to
the total acres, shows how little tillage is attended to even by those who
are the best able to carry it on; and the column of turnips proves in the
clearest manner what the progress of improvement is in that kingdom.&nbsp;
The number of horses may almost be esteemed a satire upon common sense;
were they well fed enough to be useful, they would not be so numerous, but
I have found a good hack for a common ride scarce in a house where there
were a hundred.&nbsp; Upon an average, the horses in gentlemen&rsquo;s
stables throughout the kingdom are not fed half so well as they are in
England by men of equal fortune; yet the number makes the expense of them
very heavy.</p>
<p>Another circumstance to be remarked in the country life is the
miserableness of many of their houses; there are men of five thousand a
year in Ireland, who live in habitations that a man of seven hundred a year
in England would disdain; an air of neatness, order, dress, and
<i>propret&eacute;</i>, is wanting to a surprising degree around the
mansion; even new and excellent houses have often nothing of this about
them.&nbsp; But the <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>badness of the houses is remedying every hour
throughout the whole kingdom, for the number of new ones just built, or
building, is prodigiously great.&nbsp; I should suppose there were not ten
dwellings in the kingdom thirty years ago that were fit for an English pig
to live in.&nbsp; Gardens were equally bad, but now they are running into
the contrary extreme, and wall in five, six, ten, and even twenty Irish
acres for a garden, but generally double or treble what is necessary.</p>
<p>The tables of people of fortune are very plentifully spread; many
elegantly, differing in nothing from those of England.&nbsp; I think I
remarked that venison wants the flavour it has with us, probably for the
same reason, that the produce of rich parks is never equal to that of poor
ones; the moisture of the climate, and the richness of the soil, give fat
but not flavour.&nbsp; Another reason is the smallness of the parks, a man
who has three or four thousand acres in his hands, has not perhaps above
three or four hundred in his deer-park, and range is a great point for good
venison.&nbsp; Nor do I think that garden vegetables have the flavour found
in those of England, certainly owing to the climate; green peas I found
everywhere perfectly insipid, and lettuce, etc., not good.&nbsp; Claret is
the common wine of all tables, and so much inferior to what is drunk in
England, that it does not appear to be the same wine; but their port is
incomparable, so much better than the English, as to prove, if proof was
wanting, the <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>abominable adulterations it must undergo with us.&nbsp; Drinking
and duelling are two charges which have long been alleged against the
gentlemen of Ireland, but the change of manners which has taken place in
that kingdom is not generally known in England.&nbsp; Drunkenness ought no
longer to be a reproach, for at every table I was at in Ireland I saw a
perfect freedom reign, every person drank just as little as they pleased,
nor have I ever been asked to drink a single glass more than I had an
inclination for; I may go farther and assert that hard drinking is very
rare among people of fortune; yet it is certain that they sit much longer
at table than in England.&nbsp; I was much surprised at first going over to
find no summons to coffee, the company often sitting till eight, nine, or
ten o&rsquo;clock before they went to the ladies.&nbsp; If a gentleman
likes tea or coffee, he retires without saying anything; a stranger of rank
may propose it to the master of the house, who from custom contrary to that
of England, will not stir till he receives such a hint, as they think it
would imply a desire to save their wine.&nbsp; If the gentlemen were
generally desirous of tea, I take it for granted they would have it, but
their slighting is one inconvenience to such as desire it, not knowing when
it is provided, conversation may carry them beyond the time, and then if
they do trifle over the coffee it will certainly be cold.&nbsp; There is a
want of attention in this, which the ladies should remedy, if they will not
break the old custom <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>and send to the gentlemen, which is what they
ought to do, they certainly should have a salver fresh.&nbsp; I must,
however, remark, that at the politest tables, which are those of people who
have resided much out of Ireland, this point is conducted exactly as it is
in England.</p>
<p>Duelling was once carried to an excess, which was a real reproach and
scandal to the kingdom; it of course proceeded from excessive drinking; as
the cause has disappeared, the effect has nearly followed; not however,
entirely, for it is yet far more common among people of fashion than in
England.&nbsp; Of all practices, a man who felt for the honour of his
country would wish soonest to banish this, for there is not one favourable
conclusion to be drawn from it: as to courage, nobody can question that of
a polite and enlightened nation, entitled to a share of the reputation of
the age; but it implies uncivilised manners, an ignorance of those forms
which govern polite societies, or else a brutal drunkenness; the latter is
no longer the cause or the pretence.&nbsp; As to the former, they would
place the national character so backward, would take from it so much of its
pretence to civilisation, elegance and politeness of manners, that no true
Irishman would be pleased with the imputation.&nbsp; Certain it is, that
none are so captious as those who think themselves neglected or despised;
and none are so ready to believe themselves either one or the other as
persons unused to <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>good company.&nbsp; Captious people,
therefore, who are ready to take an affront, must inevitably have been
accustomed to ill company, unless there should be something uncommonly
crooked in their natural dispositions, which is not to be supposed.&nbsp;
Let every man that fights his one, two, three, or half-a-dozen duels,
receive it as a maxim, that every one he adds to the number is but an
additional proof of his being ill-educated, and having vitiated his manners
by the contagion of bad company; who is it that can reckon the most
numerous rencontres? who but the bucks, bloods, landjobbers, and little
drunken country gentlemen?&nbsp; Ought not people of fashion to blush at a
practice which will very soon be the distinction only of the most
contemptible of the people? the point of honour will and must remain for
the decision of certain affronts, but it will rarely be had recourse to in
polite, sensible, and well-bred company.&nbsp; The practice among real
gentlemen in Ireland every day declining is a strong proof that a knowledge
of the world corrects the old manners, and consequently its having ever
been prevalent was owing to the causes to which I have attributed it.</p>
<p>There is another point of manners somewhat connected with the present
subject, which partly induced me to place a motto at the head of this
section.&nbsp; It is the conduct of juries; the criminal law of Ireland is
the same as that of England, but in the execution it is <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>so different as
scarcely to be known.&nbsp; I believe it is a fact, at least I have been
assured so, that no man was ever hanged in Ireland for killing another in a
duel: the security is such that nobody ever thought of removing out of the
way of justice, yet there have been deaths of that sort, which had no more
to do with honour than stabbing in the dark.&nbsp; I believe Ireland is the
only country in Europe, I am sure it is the only part of the British
dominions, where associations among men of fortune are necessary for
apprehending ravishers.&nbsp; It is scarcely credible how many young women
have even of late years been ravished, and carried off in order (as they
generally have fortunes) to gain to appearance a voluntary marriage.&nbsp;
These actions, it is true, are not committed by the class I am considering
at present; but they are tried by them, and acquitted.&nbsp; I think there
has been only one man executed for that crime, which is so common as to
occasion the associations I mentioned; it is to this supine execution of
the law that such enormities are owing.&nbsp; Another circumstance which
has the effect of screening all sorts of offenders, is men of fortune
protecting them, and making interest for their acquittal, which is attended
with a variety of evil consequences.&nbsp; I heard it boasted in the county
of Fermanagh, that there had not been a man hanged in it for two-and-twenty
years; all I concluded from this <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>was, that there had
been many a jury who deserved it richly.</p>
<p>Let me, however, conclude what I have to observe on the conduct of the
principal people residing in Ireland, that there are great numbers among
them who are as liberal in all their ideas as any people in Europe; that
they have seen the errors which have given an ill character to the manners
of their country, and done everything that example could effect to produce
a change: that that happy change has been partly effected, and is effecting
every hour, insomuch that a man may go into a vast variety of families
which he will find actuated by no other principles than those of the most
cultivated politeness, and the most liberal urbanity.</p>
<p>But I must now come to another class of people, to whose conduct it is
almost entirely owing that the character of the nation has not that lustre
abroad, which I dare assert it will soon very generally merit: this is the
class of little country gentlemen; tenants, who drink their claret by means
of profit rents; jobbers in farms; bucks; your fellows with round hats,
edged with gold, who hunt in the day, get drunk in the evening, and fight
the next morning.&nbsp; I shall not dwell on a subject so perfectly
disagreeable, but remark that these are the men among whom drinking,
wrangling, quarrelling, fighting, ravishing, etc. etc. are found as in
their native soil; once to a degree that made them <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>a pest of society;
they are growing better, but even now, one or two of them got by accident
(where they have no business) into better company are sufficient very much
to derange the pleasures that result from a liberal conversation.&nbsp; A
new spirit; new fashions; new modes of politeness exhibited by the higher
ranks are imitated by the lower, which will, it is to be hoped, put an end
to this race of beings; and either drive their sons and cousins into the
army or navy, or sink them into plain farmers like those we have in
England, where it is common to see men with much greater property without
pretending to be gentlemen.&nbsp; I repeat it from the intelligence I
received, that even this class are very different from what they were
twenty years ago, and improve so fast that the time will soon come when the
national character will not be degraded by any set.</p>
<p>That character is upon the whole respectable: it would be unfair to
attribute to the nation at large the vices and follies of only one class of
individuals.&nbsp; Those persons from whom it is candid to take a general
estimate do credit to their country.&nbsp; That they are a people learned,
lively, and ingenious, the admirable authors they have produced will be an
eternal monument; witness their Swift, Sterne, Congreve, Boyle, Berkeley,
Steele, Farquhar, Southerne, and Goldsmith.&nbsp; Their talent for
eloquence is felt, and acknowledged in the parliaments of both the
kingdoms.&nbsp; <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Our own service both by sea and land, as well
as that (unfortunately for us) of the principal monarchies of Europe, speak
their steady and determined courage.&nbsp; Every unprejudiced traveller who
visits them will be as much pleased with their cheerfulness, as obliged by
their hospitality; and will find them a brave, polite, and liberal
people.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
